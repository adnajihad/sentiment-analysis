0,magnolia left me relling from the theatre  staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft  at nearly three and a half hours  magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film  it not only demands your attention  but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions  it is delirious  depressing  heady  pretentious  surreal filmmaking  its also a movie that will polarize its viewers  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast  wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesnt let up until an oddly exhilerating  biblically influenced pseudoclimax  the characters make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives  there is frank mackey  tom cruise   a slithery snake charmer of men whose  search and destroy  seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants  there is earl partridge  jason robards   a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son  there is game show host jimmy gator  phillip baker hall   a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public  and there is police officer jim kurring  john c  reilly   who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system  perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process  given equal weight are stories involving a cokeaddled emotional cripple  melora walters   a former tv quiz show champion  william h  macy   a materialistic  adulterous wife  julianne moore   a child  jeremy blackman  victimized by a mentally abusive parent  and a caring  empathetic nurse  philip seymour hoffman   hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death  lies and despair  it is not a pleasant movie  there is not one bad note in the acting  it is affecting and layered and wonderful  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene  walters plays her character with redeyed rawness and a fierce selfdestructiveness that is anxiety inducing  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man  who still hears a lions roar when he speaks  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote  the problem is that he stays on them too long  julianne moores character  linda  quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt  tears  screaming and remorse and never backs off from it  after a few hours  it turns from interesting to chinese water torture  quite a few scenes  such as the game show  go on just a bit too long and will be offputting for those used to a pat  minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around  and just what is the theme  alienation  hopelessness  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesnt make it easy  the film starts by showing three  strange and seemingly unrelated events  its a harbinger of the synchronicity to come  at times  different stories reach reach key moments at the same time  other times  stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory  regardless of what else is happening  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film  whats surprising is that it mostly works  if you have doubts about andersons intentions  ill ask you to pay attention to the final frame  despite all the sturm und drang  magnolia ultimately speaks to mans capacity for hope and attempts at redemption  despite magnolias needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur  showing off fro the masses  i have to admire his guts  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling  my rating  a bulleye    stars  a side note  helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful  when she sings  save me  at the end  it enhances the yearning felt by the characters  just as  wise up  mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives  ,1,1
1,about an hour or so into  the jackal   a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence  and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out  i hope she gets killed now   at that point it hit me  i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because hes being played by sidney poitier  you know somethings rotten in the state of denmark  every year  a couple films like this are released  you know  the cheap  action packed international espionnage film  featuring a semipromising premise  some bigname actors  usually bruce willis   and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago  this was the third one of   following the very lackluster  the saint   which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe  and the surprisingly fun  the peacemaker   featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain    the jackal  tries to mix both elements  and you thought  the saint  was bad    the jackal  is loosely  very loosely  i hope  based on the  fred zimmerman classic that ive yet to see   the day of the jackal   which featured  apparently  a suave hitman called the jackal  played by edward fox  trying to assasinate charles degaule  well  welcome to the s  where a sorta suave hitman  also called the jackal  bruce willis   trying to kill the head of the fbi    or is he  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother  killed in the opening scenes   the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere  from helsinki to virginia  setting up an elaborate scheme wherein hell be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion  and like the saint  the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people  the agent working on the case  cater preston  sidney poitier  yes  that sidney poitier   working with a russian agent  valentina koslova  diane venora  lady capulet from  romeo  juliet    gives up early on and meets with an exira man  declan mulqueen  richard gere  putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of   whos in a massachusetts jail  but who has apparently seen the jackal  who has been eluding the law forever  soon  hes out working with the two untrusting agents  and trying to help them catch him  there are numerous problems with the film  and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller  but save a couple moments  the film never achieves suspense  or even a sense of intrigue  sure  the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense  but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience  or even an entertaining one  it doesnt help that the plot is designed to be complex  but falls into so many problems  like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances  the script of  the jackal  is a complete mess  mostly because it cant decide what it wants to focus on  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer  is it a film about a nasty  amoral hitman whos in everything for the money  or is it a combination of both    the jackal  aims for the latter  but never focuses in on either character  the connection between the two feels completely edited  so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan  you wonder how he recognized him so fast  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan  most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend  isabella  mathilda may   given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then  the supporting characters are worse  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role  that of a man who is just stern sometimes  and other times more giving and likable  what is poitier doing here  hes one of the best living actors  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this  diane venoras russian character is almost as bad  with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth  and a plastered on expressionless facade  its not that anyones bad here  its that they have nothing to do  the plot is a joke  feeling like it was pasted together by someone in postproduction who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain  there are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself  the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill  take a scene where hes being followed by some agents into a parking garage  he quickly sprays his car another color  and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it  doesnt killing someone attract more attention than it does distract  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place  geez  is there anything good here  well    a couple things  i did like williss icy expressions  he may not have been real suave or anything  but some of his looks are worth a chuckle  richard gere has a couple of good moments  making his character as likable as he possibly could have  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous  completely inane but fun kinda way  most notably  a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder  jack black   and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man  which has its share of a couple good jokes  most particular a kiss by willis  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go  theyre just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is  the jackal   director michael catonjones  who directed the far superior  rob roy   has made a film that is made very couple months  one that is unentertaining  unintriguing  and pretty much cold  but will nevertheless make money because  hey  the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retroclancy kinda way  every now and then  the filmmakers get it right   clear and present danger   which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way   but  the jackal  is an example of when they go completely wrong  ,0,0
2,richard linklaters  slacker   made in  for a budget of only     immerses itself in the twentysomething  collegetown culture of austin  texas  most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning  their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation  they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy  the pervasiveness of slave morality  the subtle messages in pop culture  and such  ask them what theyve been doing lately  and theyll more likely than not reply   oh  you know  just hanging out   linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters  the camera follows one person for a few minutes  then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person  who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door        its certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk  some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas  some of them are just plain weird  and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are  the opening monologue  delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver  tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film  other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy  while groups of pseudointellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle briberybased morality in  scoobydoo   for the most part  however  the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types  near the beginning  a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks  warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars  another man seems to be collecting televisions  keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera  and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film  a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below  the only problem with  slacker  is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end  since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character  the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while  there are only so many times you can hear   hey  whats going on     not much  what are you up to     nothing really  just hanging around   before it gets on your nerves  the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization  and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half  a jfk buff  for example  seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist  and many of the characters just generally arent as weird or unique  instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first  linklater shows us the oddballs first  then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too    slacker  is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy  whatever its flaws  and its status as a cult classic is welldeserved  i just cant help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order  ,1,0
3,in   a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america  this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world  and she was  she was also build to be one of the most luxurious  and that she was  finally  she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not  to get a ticket for this voyage you either  spent a lifes savings to get to america to start life anew  were part of the upper class and had the money to spare  or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson  jack dawson makes the trip  and happens to be at the right place at the right time  rose dewitt bukater  a first class passenger  climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping  thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue  and a tale of death and tragedy    this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago  an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia  the movie titanic shows what happened  maybe not with a  degree of accuracy  but it still shows it very realisticaly  now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story  it serves as both admirably  brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating  this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is  but that alone is not enough  the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective  movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency  the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable  the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting  with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie  part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting  and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast  the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles  looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they arent acting but are actually the characters in the movie  the casting for the movie could really have been better  in my humble opinion that is  one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself  yes  you read correctly  the ship is a character  how is the titanic a character  you ask well simple  a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you  this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this  mr  cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense  all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp  now  to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards  the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking  in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there  you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening  if your imagination is good   the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique  the movie will leave you amazed at the effects  and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie  just humans and an oversized ship  the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions  the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes  now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies  now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch  i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end  the historical value of this movie is quite high  and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy  for it is extremely well done  the method of telling the story is also good  maybe not totally unique but effective none the less  regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at  the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing  if you get the chance to see this movie go    it might not be the best movie in the world   but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it  during none of the  hours and  minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie  ,1,1
4,who knew that in  years eddie murphy  who made such a brash  raucous bigscreen splash in hrs    would become    cuddly  the disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy  largely laughfree doctordolittle continues with this earnesttoafault dramedy  although he is topbilled  here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum  who plays ricky hayman  the programming director at a home shopping network  sales are way down  and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g  murphy   a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air  while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation  the reinvigorated rickys greed grows  endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant  kelly preston   writer tom schulman has some promising ideas  satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity  but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film  the sluggishly paced holyman is not only slow and overlong   minutes   but an unfunny bore  and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings  cleansed of both the attitude and comic sensibility that made him a star  g is  for the most part  a straight man   he is a curiously lifeless presence  goldblum is actually quite good  but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested  either  ,0,0
5,for about twenty minutes into mission impossible  director john woo  the killer  hard boiled  face off  appears to have made an exciting  elegant  charming spy thriller  kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american  read  unsophisticated  hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  sadly  as the picture progresses  the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up  twohour long episode of magyuver  and not a particularly good one at that  what went wrong  mi begins flashily enough  that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot  but it only gives way to more flash  then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool  early on  during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt  tom cruise  and nyah nordoffhall  thandie newton   woo works some of his trademark magic  in one hypnotic  though completely inexplicable sequence  the director slows the action down to a languid semistall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes with come hither sexuality    just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance  coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff  prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain  sans scaffolding  then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another  why  i havent the foggiest  i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  with mi woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine  the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects  its possible that these  spies  could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off  though of course this is never explored  the scenes ive described are really only included to titillate  not to give any insight into character  god forbid  woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic  but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commerciallike visuals  still in terms of crackerjack eye candy  the opening has much to cherish  cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices  the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage  romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is   between the frantic dancing  woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa  kind of way  yet it has style and something of soul  and woo casts a bit of a spell on us  sure its all smoke and mirrors  but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product  thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez  george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight  they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres  newton bats her eyes flirtatiously  cruise grins a little too slyly  the cruise character  ethan hunt  has been drastically altered since the first film  here cruise plays him more as a hip  sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part   hes cool and dashing  which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut  which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film   and blustered his way through magnolia  quite possibly the most overrated performance of the s   sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial  im the man   charm and more slomo closeups of his preening mug  mi falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act  which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop  the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle  the first gun fight in the film   which really should be unheard of in a john woo film  but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi  of course excepting the  symbolic  pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture   weve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand  it isnt done any differently here  the action is pure hard target  broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind  hes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie  the actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks  he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment  be it during a gunfight  before one or after one  when hes not beaming away  hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell  but woos editing seriously undermines the effort  he fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof  i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers  in a classic woo action moment  ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pinup boy angel of death  the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual  one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise  basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does   the lead bad guy  played by the appropriately british dougray scott  and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken    on motorcycles  though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment  the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug  only to fly about a hundred feet  still in bear hug position   land on a beach below and begin a manoemano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a  so you thought i was dead      not to worry  cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat  what a hero  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mis plot  my reasoning is simple  im not sure of any good it would do  the film itself has absolutely no concern with story  only with hurtling forth to the next  special  effect  i wasnt kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi has less plot than the average aerosmith video  nobody will go to this for the plot  and if they do theyll surely regret it  as summer movies evolve  or devolve  character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing  in mi  the plot seemed to be built around brian de palmas  that films director  stylistic flourishes  while in mi the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woos nonstop masturbatory pandemonium  its irrelevant in every sense  as is character  all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors  ,0,0
6,a couple of months ago  when i first downloaded the faceoff trailer from the net  my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold yawn  followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key  not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this pisspoor trailer  then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u  s      unique    excellent     mustsee  well  i thought still skeptical  i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here  here  of course  was still three months away  ill admit  when i trotted off to see this film  the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow  id heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled  but his films were definitely not on my mustsee list  that  let me tell you  has changed completely  i knew this fact only five minutes into the film  after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet  the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick  seriously  ive never been a big john travolta fan  but he  like cage  perfectly suited his role in the movie      sorry  make that roles in the movie  even travoltas great performance  however  paled in comparison to cages character portrayals  my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hasslers hideout  half drugged out of his mind  he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his sons death from castors perspective   doesnt it just break your heart   he mutters coldly  now dont go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie  its not  thats what really makes this movie unique  its an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters      not a common mix at all  suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though      thats the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around  rounds at each other     and never hit  several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press rewind and watch it over again  the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a doublesided mirror is just plain brilliant  whilst cages and travoltas performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies  the lesser characters are just as intriguing  joan allen  who usually sticks to the straight drama movies  plays her part perfectly as archers long suffering wife  i like the fact that her character didnt end up toting a gun at the end of the movie    it would have wrecked her potrayal  gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troys mistreated girlfriend      make that  one of  castor troys mistreated girlfriends  other movies would have used her character as just window dressing    a sex object  but instead her character is very strong and independent  dominique swain  who plays archers daughter  also does a nice job  though her character is not as explored as much as allens or gershons  faults  well    there were some i have to say  first  the movies ending  whilst being very good overall  was a bit too drawn out for its own good  after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you cant help but think   geez  are you guys nuclear powered or what    there were certain bits that werent handled properly  like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platformprison  more explanation here would have been nice  overall  this movie was not perfect  but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect  many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made      i certainly hope so  ,1,1
7,synopsis  an attractive mute makeup artist  working on an ultracheesy slasher movie in moscow  witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians  meanwhile  the artists sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her  comments  mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it  drawn by the clever artwork on the video box  i rented the film expecting a complete turkey  mute witness  however  was original  offbeat  and wellmade  its one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about  ive subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit  and it may be seen  on occasion  on the independent film channel  the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense  as billy  the quite believable mute heroine  sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film  the rest of the film takes good advantage of billys vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures  to throw a curveball into the fray  billys sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes  a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film  look for alec guinness  obiwan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy  in a small role as the evil reaper  definately check this movie out  although  as a word of warning  it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly arent for the squeamish  ,1,1
8,it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part  on the day that one of its stars  roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of   mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood  having a career that spanned over  years and appearing in more than  films  fright night part  probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles  this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was  william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us    at least in the movies anyway   it has been several years since charlie brewster  ragsdale  and bmovie actor turned late night horror film host  peter vincent  mcdowall  came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlies next door neighbor  charlie and peter won that battle  but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family  apparently charlies former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling  so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge  this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again  one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlies stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood  fright night part  tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort  while they are stylish  the vamps in this film just dont have the personality of the undead in the first film  with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes  one bright spot  speaking from a strictly sexist point of view  is traci lin  who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend  its really a shame that her career hasnt been better since she made this film  ragsdale does a fair job in this film  but doesnt give nearly the performance that he did in the original  roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given  which unfortunately isnt much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie  i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way  the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner  part  had more of the feel of a music video  never a good thing for a horror film  another minus for part  was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare  for that matter  they were almost nonexistent  if i was going to watch a horror film  this would be far from my first choice  the first fright night  on the other hand  would be right up near the top of my list  if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film id probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes  either way fright night part  would most likely not enter into the equation  ,0,0

ill fortune on the set  impressive photography  but really only interesting to film historians  sadie thompson  u  s  a     director  raoul walsh screenwriter  raoul walsh  from the john colton play  rain   based on w  somerset maughams story  miss thompson  cast  gloria swanson  raoul walsh  lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newlyrestored version of frank capras lost horizon  where several scenes had been restored using stills  i was interested to see sadie thompson  where the last  minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago  this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story  miss thompson   this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness  and a very clever script  the actors  gloria swanson  raoul walsh  who also directed and wrote the screenplay  and especially lionel barrymore  as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadies soul  but really wants to get her between the sheets  is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel  swanson adds real life to the character  adding an worldly  affectionate air to the bawdy sadie  unfortunately  the ending is rather poorly tied up  it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film  or the original script  the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on  i cannot believe maughams short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia   the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion weve been waiting an hour and a half for  still  its entertaining right up to the end  certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance  which  nonetheless  works  perhaps due to the silent screen  is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells  bakkers  and robertses of the religious worlds  a c movie  worth    if you can find it  the pied piper  czechoslovakia    director  jim barta screenwriter  kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids  it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate  and with a lot of political comment along with it  perhaps economic content is a better wordit certainly doesnt show capitalism in a good light  nor human nature  nor anything else  for that matter  as you may have guessed  this is not a tgif film  this is the kind of film you are glad is over  not that it wasnt interesting for technical reasons  this is stopanimation that is very well done  all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnutsexcept for the animated stuffed rats  boy  sounds like a real comedy vehicle  doesnt it  add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison  and you have something to give the wee ones  and some of the mentally unstable larger folk  to keep them up at night  some gore  dont bring children to this one  dont bring adults to this one  unless theyre fascinated by puppetry andor hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped  blech    no fun whatsoever  meier  west germany    directorscreenwriter  peter timm cast  rainier grenkowitz  nadja engelbrecht  alexander

deal of money  his uncle  also in the west  sneaks meier out of the country  unknown to the east germans  meier  however  is less than thrilled his girlfriend  his friends and his job  which he likes  all exist in east germany  after a roundtheworld trip  his boss thinks hes on leave in bulgaria   meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id  and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crews workwhile everyone thinks hes still living in east germany  of course  something goes wrongand the ending is very funny  but it takes the film too long to get there  the humor is spread too thin  and much of the plot is too obvious  as is the acting   still  a good concept for the comedy  and the last five minutes are pretty funny  c      the right hand man  australia    director  di drew screenplay  helen hodgman cast  rupert everett  hugo weaving  arthur dignam  jennifer claire  catherine mcclements after a lifetime of moviegoing  and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival  ive learned several rules which  while not absolute  should certainly be given deference to    be wary of french comedies  these people like jerry lewis    ken russell is never going to grow up  no matter how long you wait    any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as  old poutylips  is probably not worth watching    when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography  watch out  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo  but since weir and miller left for foreign shores  finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult  not impossiblewitness malcolm last year  task  well  i ignored rules    last night  and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards  its as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the s about tragedy among the gentry  and falling in love with people below your station  and horses  lots and lots of horses  the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship  which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing  because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir  unfortunately  said son  a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times  kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident  highlights include the amputation sequence  the doctors daughter  who has the hots for the son  tasting his urine for a diagnosis  their tender kissing with a window between them  while its rainingyoud think a woman studying medicine would know better   the photography is good  but i kept wishing for bweverything seems sepiacolored anyway  actually  i wished i was watching swimming to

10,are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store  wafflemovies  com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves  everyweek  wafflemovies  com reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video  here is a sample review  welcome to sarajevo in light of americas recent intervention in kosovo  welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years  set in sarajevo  and based on actual events  this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war  the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding  as they make their way down the street  a sniper shoots the mother of the bride  yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war  in this scene  we meet joe flynn  woody harrelson   an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church  joe is cocky  but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesnt even know  his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson  stephen dillane   michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the worlds lack of interest  henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mothers death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread  he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth  henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines  he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult  during his visits  he befriends a preteen girl  emira  emira nuseric  who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner  he promises to get emira out of harms way if he gets the chance  after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children  henderson loses hope  however  his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina  marisa tomei  and her childrens aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans  unfortunately  only babies are wanted for adoption  so henderson pledges to take emira to england  the group of children  nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy  can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps  the movie was beautifully and sensitively made  director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred  they show the destroyed lives  families that have been split up  and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with  this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson  his producer and flynn have befriended  the group of twentysomethings reside in a bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities  one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth  like the rest of those deeply effected by the war  this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live  winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room  the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the  olympics  winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities  this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies  com selection mad city  we watch them struggle to cover the horror  while trying to remain professionally detached  however  they are human and question the reason behind it all  why no one cares  and how they can get out  stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson  he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events  dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy  henderson realizes that he cannot save the world  but he can help a few  it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis learysandra bullock disaster two if by sea  woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest  most versatile actors of his generation  harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through  harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men  cheers  white men cant jump  as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one  this ability will serve him well and give him a long  successful career  americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place  for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict  the entire movie  most importantly the opening scenes  provide a history lesson  war is a foreign concept to most of us in america  battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to  televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war  this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world  something we dont do enough of in s america  ,1,1
11,susan grangers review of  two can play that game   screen gems  since the success of  waiting to exhale   there have been several romantic comedies about africanamerican professionals  this female revenge fantasy  vivica a  fox plays shante smith  a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success  a mansion  a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky  hotshot lawyer  morris chestnut  shes at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girlfriends  monique  wendy racquel robinson  tamala jones     when your man messes up  no matter how small it is   she smugly decrees   yuh gots to punish him   so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival  gabrielle union  she devises her own version of  the rules   a day  tough love  emotionally punishing plan to get him back  unfortunately  writerdirector mark brown   how to be a player   breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy  you have to like the protagonist  and shrill  selfcongratulatory shante smith is a smirking  superficial  spiteful shrew who doesnt realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love  having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the  day one    day two  titlecard device underscores the tedium  comic anthony anderson scores as chestnuts boisterous bestfriend  and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic whos given a smooth makeover by ms  robinson  but the outtakes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself  on the granger movie gauge of  to    two can play that game  is smarmy if slick   filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements  cocacola  miller genuine draft  but little else  in this rrated  for explicit sexual language   pseudohip battle of the sexes  the audience loses  ,0,0
12,synopsis  in this movie  steven spielberg  one of todays finest directors  attempts to spice up the s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque  djimon hounsou    a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery   and his fellow prisoners  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders  but since the americans dont speak cinques language  the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves  technically  since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time  people like cinque couldnt be kidnapped into slavery  one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave  lawyers baldwin and adams  matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins  must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery  rather than born slaves  in order to get them out of prison as free men  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielbergs trademark panache   flashy beginning  lots of facial closeups  big music  and dramatic imagery  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters  opinion  making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life  in fiction  one invents purposeful  clearcut good guys and bad guys  puts the fictional characters in conflict  and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion  real life  however  consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around  think thoughts and do nothing  or come and go before events are resolved  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances  ,1,1
13,truman   trueman   burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this film  president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide  in spite of  or was it because of  his stature    truman  also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war  an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans  and burbank  california  brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc  if hollywood is the center of the film world  burbank is  or was  the center of tvs world  the world where our protagonist lives  combine all these names and concepts into  truman burbank   and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world  truman leads the perfect life  his town  his car  and his wife are picture perfect  his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky  the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart      but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light  the next day during the drive to work  the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements  he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian  when the radio comes back to normal  the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully  his suspicion aroused  he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities  the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator  the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks  a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door  made to look like the back of an elevator  into place  two security guards grab him and throw him out  truman is really suspicious now  it gets even worse the next day when his wife  a nurse  describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge    its best not to think about it   she says  trying vainly to change trumans memory  truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense  at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town  his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world  you know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program  his actions are  real  but everything else is carefully scripted  from the death of his father to the choice of his wife  truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is  meanwhile  christof  the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy  its sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view  or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view  we root for the captive of the cageworld  our protagonist is counting on  chaos theory  to help him escape his elaborate trap  the story  written by andrew niccol  writerdirector of gattaca   introduces some interesting questions  such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life  or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake  although these questions came to mind  i dont think the film itself asked them  it certainly didnt address them or try to answer them  i was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show  carreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain  but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing  earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well  the two seemed exclusive of one another  but weir and niccol didnt see it that way  perhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt  but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here  but on its own terms  the movie is well made  sight  sound and pacing are all handled competently  much of the first part of the movie is the truman show  the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras  with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen  one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio  the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen  the music is wellchosen and scored  the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music  when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect  when the movie ends  the score sounds more like a frantic  driven  tangerine dream opus  while still keeping the same timbre  philip glass epic music  from powaqqatsi  permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening    glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show   and the pacing of the story was brisk  there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show  just a few quick title cards  a few interviews  and then right into the show  and the movie  one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling  there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart  because it wasnt necessary  we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble  and no sooner  theres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down  its a quick  straight shot to the movies end  in terms of overall quality  i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca  both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds  but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas  neither film  clicked  and became an instant classic  nevertheless  i look forward to niccols next film  whatever it may be  ,1,1
14,i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan  ive seen some of his films  silkwood  backdraft  unlawful entry  and while he gave adequate performances  i have never been impressed with his work  breakdown  then  is something of a surprise  russell gives a fine performance  as do most of the cast  one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film  to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true  but he does it no harm  russell plays jeff  one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy  kathleen quinlan  cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life  while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and  left helpless and stranded  jeff waves down a passing truck driver  j  t  walsh  who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck  because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians  jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help  that  it seems  is the last time jeff  or anyone else  sees her  breakdown has been compared to several movies  george sluizers the vanishing  the original  hopefully  not his appalling hollywood remake   steven spielbergs duel and any number of hitchcock films  as with these  breakdown does not  for the most part  stray down the conventional path of the american actionthriller  jeff does not become a guntoting vigilante on the hunt for his wife  but instead becomes a scared  confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on  when we do find out what has happened to amy  it does come as a slight disappointment  if only because its too early in the film  i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment  but this affects the film little  russell  as mentioned earlier  is very good in his role  and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo   j  t  walsh  as the possibly evil truck driver  is terrific  he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesnt seem to know what to do with  but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here  the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person  one anyone would be able to trust  which makes the plot that much more believable  breakdown is what hollywood doesnt make enough of  a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do  indeed  have viewers on the edge of their seats  one of the most genuinely exciting films ive seen in a long time  ,1,1
15,some movies prerelease buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released  everyone just goes along with it  thus sometimes  films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations  last year it was the thin red line  this years  winner  is the hurricane  pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  and thats supposed to be ok because  see  its a true story  its about rubin  hurricane  carter  denzel washington   a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly  racist   detective  dan hedaya  whos had it in for the  bigshot  hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife  in selfdefense but who cares  right   when rubin was only ten  he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  most of the film takes place when he is in his th year in prison  to the rescue  lesra martin  vicellous reon shannon  and his team of wannabe detectives  lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three welloff canadian white people  hanna  unger  schreiber  to get an education  lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book   the sixteenth round   rubins autobiography  immediately thereafter  schreibers character tells lesra  sometimes we dont pick the books we read  they pick us   hmmm  after a few visits to the prison  they become convinced of rubins innocence and launch their own fullscale investigation even though two juries have convicted him  they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses  i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces   and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricanes innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings  of course  were already told that hes innocent  a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  all too obviously  were getting the hollywood watered down version  that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it  its almost cruel  the melodrama isnt of the entertaining kind either  its the hokey  rammeddownyourthroat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity  witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudosaintliness of our four protagonists  the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except its a nofrills courtroom movie  its formula stripped to the bare necessities  you have your wrongly accused black man  you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene  but theres nothing else  youd expect some sort of involving investigation  but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence  thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding  brooding to himself  brooding to other inmates  brooding to lesra  brooding to lesras canadian friends  brooding in letters  i dont think ill ever look at brooding the same way again  it wasnt long before i got tired of hearing the hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations on his condition  i wanted something to happen  as for washingtons performance in the title role  i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received  he is top notch  though still boring  how is that possible  well  he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly  unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap  what a waste of a great performer  speaking of wastes  why the hell did john hannah agree to do this  hes an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly  but what is he doing here  to call his character  along with schreibers and ungers  a stick figure would be a gross understatement  all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas  as benevolent as dogooders come  if theyre to play a major part in this movie  why not make them real people  with real feelings and emotions  look  if youre going to make a formula movie  dont undermine the formula  courtroom dramas can be fun  but this is ridiculous  not only is it trite  its boring  ,0,0

17,field of dreams almost defies description  although its about baseball  its not a baseball movie  although the film is extremely spiritual  its not about religion  and although field of dreams is melodramatic  its not a tearjerker  to really understand what field of dreams is all about  you have to see it  in the film  kevin costner plays ray kinsella  a baseball fan  s berkeley graduate  and iowa farmer  one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields  ray hears a voice  it tells him   if you build it  he will come   then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn  shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again  and even though it depletes his familys savings and his neighbors think hes crazy  ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field  complete with bleachers and flood lights    if you build it  he will come   and lo and behold  shoeless joe does comebringing with him several of his dead teammates  and then ray hears the voice again  it tells him to  ease his pain   ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann  an influential and radical novelist from the s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society  with great aplomb  james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey  the cast in field of dreams is excellent  especially kevin costner in the lead role  costner gives a quiet  subtle  and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life  costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale  amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as rays feisty and loving wife  who against her better judgement supports her husbands crazy ideas  in her most impressive scene  madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p  t  a  meeting  displaying the sincere passion of a s berkeley radical  ray liotta is appropriately eerie and aweinspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe  the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the  chicago  black sox  scandal  and finally  burt lancaster is memorable in a small  but important  role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning  field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life  wonder  mystery  spirit  and humor  it  for the most part  succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief  ray kinsellas spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous  but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama  it unfortunately does at times go overboard  and by the end it gets downright sappy  in general  however  field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasyone i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics  ,1,1

josh lucas   who is seeing his old girlfriend  mike  coscreenwriter steven gevedon  has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions  hence  the title  with inmate mary hobbs  a multipersonality patient with a dark secret  gordos nephew  jeff  brendan sexton iii   suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital  as the agreed upon week draws to an end  hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone  something   in the hospital  tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away  but  there is more  much more  at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all  i dont want to give away too much of the story of  session    so ill stop there  what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jumpoutatyoufromthedark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of  halloween  and  friday the thirteenth   there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror  with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film  there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what  specifically  is  frightening   as i watched  session   i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie  the striking highdefinition video camera work by uta briesewitz  who worked with the director  brad anderson  on his  next stop wonderland   helps to build up tension with closeups  fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud  music  too  is used to intense effect  joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening  even horrifying  couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of  the shining    the blair witch project  and  even  the texas chainsaw massacre  and you get a decent  intriguing horror flick  additionally  the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character  the institution itself  which lends even more chills to the equation  acting is another factor that raises  session   above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like  scream    i know what you did last summer  and their sequels  those films took goodlooking  though generic  young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count  substituting mayhem for real horror  anderson opted  instead  to use mature  experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable  mullan  in particular  puts an arc on his character  gordon  as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family  job and  finally  danvers state hospital  the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people  not just fodder for the mayhem  david caruso  as gordos senior man and near equal in the business  shows just how good an actor he is  he made the jump from tvs  nypd blue  to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took  ill never forget the horrendous  jade   were less than star making  he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here  gevedon  lucas and sexton are more than fodder  too  the only problem with  session   lay in the uninspired ending  it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific  and inspired  build up  the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film   session   is an unusual feat  it is scary  doesnt use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered  subtle horror  because of the local interest of danvers  it should do well with the northeast crowd  i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves  i give it a b  ,1,1
19,fantastically over hyped  godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands  then an attack on a boat from some beast  and finally we join dr  nick tatopoulos  broderick looking about  years old  doing some research in chernobyl  some shady u  s government guys appear  and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints  from what looks like a giant lizard  and whats more  this beast is heading for new york  gulp  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride  and at some points it is  there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie  the main faults lie with the acting and writing  common problems with summer blockbuster movies  broderick is pretty useless as the hero  with no humour or a tough guy image  while emmerichs previous summer flick  independence day    had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith  this has neither  also  maria pitillo  as brodericks former girlfriend  is just as useless  with a chronic disability in acting  shes incapable of showing emotion  speaks every line in the same way  and basically shes total crap  its up to french actor jean reno to save the day  and indeed he does  turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named animal  and he adds a little life to the picture  also making an appearance is harry shearer  probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons  as a slimy news reporter  o  k  so the acting is not up to par  but it never is in these movies  but what about the script  well  thats not up to par either  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script  the dialogue is banal  broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters thats a lot of fish     and the character development is non existent  reno plays the typical frenchman  no croissant     broderick forever remains a geeky scientist   also  the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic  and theres an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert    the mayor is mayor ebert  and is assistant is called gene  ha ha ha ha    the plot is dire  and in the end just rips off jurassic park    by having lots of baby godzillas  i  e  velicorapters  running around new york  right  so the script and acting suck  but what about the special effects  thankfully  theyre are quite good  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi  although we dont see much of him because the movie is so dark  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell  but although they are impressive  they cant save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie  the movie goes on for far too long aswell  and it cant seem to decide on a ending  and of course  the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel  lets just hope one never arrives  ,0,0
20,i swear i have seen the edge before  in fact  it reminded me of the bear  the river wild  and other various films mixed into an entirely different film  however  the edge has done something that most action films should do  and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot  in doing so  the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than  say  the peacemaker  unfortunately  because of those overused moments  we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film  but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head  one surprise  in particular  left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script  action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood  and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us  they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre  intelligence  even horror films have learned this  a genre which is probably the least respected of them all  the river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films i have seen from the s  the intelligence of the screenplay  and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day  the edge has the intelligence and smart characters  but this time the lack of originality is the downfall  i must admit that it was very suspenseful  and had an original third half  but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes  this is an example of the final act saving the film  instead of the other way around  as in the lost world   if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity  it could have become a great action film  and i use the term loosely   the edge is pretty much a survivalofthefittest film  but taking screams lead  the edge makes fun of the genres cliches  and then uses them  though not quite as effectively   charles morse  anthony hopkins  is the main character  a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him  for once  we dont immediately care for the main character  instead  we like bob  alec baldwin   a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife  mickey  elle macpherson   out in the wilderness  they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic  charles birthday is the same day  and he receives a gold watch from his wife  and a pocket knife from bob  as action films go  these items do have importance to the rest of the story  but quite a bit more than we first expect  soon  however  bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his  personality   charles  bob  bobs assistant steve  harold perrineau   and the pilot head off to find him  and as shown in the previews  hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter  down the plane goes  the pilot is killed  and the three are left to survive in the wilderness  director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow  and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations  he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film  take  for instance  the entire manhunting bear plot  this has been done many times in films with different animals  and even bears  but given the charles intelligence  and bobs uncertainty  many of the cliches are given fresh twists  even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before  my favorite line of the film comes from charles   most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life    thinking   despite the predictability of the main plot  a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise  and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore  i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise  so instead i will avoid it entirely  the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along  and some of charles survival techniques seem possible  even making fire from ice  tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear  but whenever the bear is present  the characters lose all sensibility  i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water  why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across  i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while  thankfully  we already have begun to care for the characters  and so we let this small detail slide  but some of the technical details are awkward  such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make  where did they get thread and needles    the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature  and borders on phenomenal  anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance  creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day  hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles  but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy  something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs  alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen  it sure is better from his fair game   baldwin can be a good or a bad character  and here he succeeds at both in a way  you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end  and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer  elle macpherson gives a good performance  albeit slight  she isnt in the film all that much  but for the scenes she does have  she handles as an actress  not as a model  harold perrineau is a good actor  and his scenes are nice and underplayed  he is eliminated early  and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable  the edge is rated r for graphic violence  some gore  and language  some of the violence is a little too disturbing  even for me  this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to  but too many cliches bog it down  director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts  david mamets script  though  has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat  and the acting is solid  the best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence  but with a small detail involving a certain gift  its a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear  and by the way  most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear  way to go  bart  ,1,1
21,breakdown is an moderately entertaining  if underwhelming  thriller  kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor  taking the scenic route to california through redneck country  however  while in the middle of nowhere  their jeep decides to break down  leaving them stranded  a friendly truck driver  warren  walsh   offers to give them a lift to town  although jeff rejects the offer  he wants to stay with his car   amy agrees  hops into warrens lorry  and promptly disappears  jeff wonders where the hell she is  and when he later catches up with warren and warren says he has never seen amy in his life  the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife  although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance    and the vanishing    plot wise  the latter two are far superior character and script wise  kurt russell is o  k as jeff  although he can seemingly only pull of one expression  which is angry  throughout the whole film  he looks angry  or just pissed off   quinlan is o  k again  but again she can only pull off one expression  which is looking dorky  throughout the whole film  she looks dorky  j  t walsh  who  sadly  recently passed away  is fine as warren  who we soon find out is a kidnapper  although his actual character is pretty weak  and not really menacing enough  the supporting cast do their best aswell  with rex linn as a doubting sheriff  and the other kidnappers  the story  written by firsttimer jonathan mostow  who also directs  is o  k  if surprisingly familiar and sometimes extraordinarily stupid  some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy  there are some flaws with the plot also  as the characters do the complete opposite to logical  presumably to keep the story exciting  and also the fact that the story just isnt strong enough to sustain the audiences attention  the picture moves along very slowly also  it almost threatens to drop dead  the picture does pick up towards the end  but by then its too late  mostow directs the action sequences well enough  however  the film doesnt really come to a satisfying conclusion  either  the ending tries to be bleak  but just comes off annoying  breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast and director  instead  it just turns out to be merely average  a missed opportunity  overall rating review by david wilcock ,0,1
22,even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material  as this subpar submarine comedy proves  down periscope stars kelsey  frasier  grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officers  james coburn  plan to get him out of the navy  like any lame emsemble comedy  the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out  the fat guy who eats all the time  the beautiful woman who doesnt belong there  lauren holly   the secondincommand who does everything by the book  rob schneider   the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out  harry dean stanton  and so on  then comes the transparent plotline  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him  and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills  where everyone seems completely inept  like the electrician who cant connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone  finally  and this covers the final hour of the movie  grammer has to lead his men  and holly  to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it  in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  first theyre singing  louie louie  like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off  then thirty minutes later  theyre making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off  the whole while  evil captain coburn is overacting underwater  cursing grammer  as most people watching the movie probably are too   its all predictable without any original humor to redeem it  the jokes are right out of  mchales navy  and other cutrate sitcoms of the past  theres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust  holds one food can up and announces   this expired in    i yelled back at the screen   so did these jokes   i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it  my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and  around the start of the second hour  i started writing my will  the blame cant really be placed on the stars  though  kelsey grammer is good in this  he just doesnt have anything to work with  his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had  welcome aboard  tatooed on his penis  grammer probably did something even worse  got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about  same for holley  save the penis part   who is likeable in down periscope just because shes so gorgeous  as for schneider  whose character is downright annoying   there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas  although hes still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the  snl  ship  my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy   okay  its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber    and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster  judging from the video box  most other movie critics agree with me  the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channels jim ferguson  i guess even jeff craig from   second preview   who said tank girl  kicks butt   without ever seeing it  didnt like this  ,0,0
23,capsule  this is a s or s style heist film  set in the present  robert deniro stars as a riskadverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend  played by marlon brando   edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime  the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense       to   i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before  this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens  there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment  there is no rock score  there are no ballet like martial arts  this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and unflashy script  nick  played by robert deniro  is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks  if a job is not a safe bet  pun intended   he backs out  sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe  when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game  he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club  and decides to manage it full time  he proposes to his girl friend diane  angela bassett   she has one condition  he must stay retired from crime  but before the deal can be cemented  max  a montreal kingpin and personal friend  has one last supposedly easy job for nick  nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal  more and more details seem to complicate the job  nicks partner in the crime is to be a smart  but uncontrollable young crook  jack  edward norton   jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat  even at his associates homes  the young crook is a knowitall who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way  together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house  the script by kario salem  lem dobbs  and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old  mission impossible  television series  we see pieces of the heist being put together  last minute changes  and things that go wrong  much like a good episode of  mission impossible   this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise  mission impossible  films  the complications are  however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable  the telling is cold and noirish  which is just what it is supposed to be  director frank oz  the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film  the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scenestealing acting  edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is lowkey by todays standards  he plays what is nearly a double role  jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house  one nice    character i have not mentioned is stephen  jamie harrold   stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mothers basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions  he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon  the film itself remains lowkey up until the time of the climactic heist  then the pace really picks up  before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes  though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown  on the subject of music  the score of the score is by howard shore  it adds tension to the suspense scenes  but never seems to have much of a melody  angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break  she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does  speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the s and s  it does the job  i rate it a  on the  to  scale and a  on the  to  scale  ,1,0
24,have you ever been in an automobile accident where youve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches  yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable  mangled wreck  well  that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation  but after watching this inane exercise of a movie  i certainly feel that ive miraculously walked away unscathed after a twohour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond  oddly  eye of the beholder   which is a psychologicalromancethriller  starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent  called the eye  ewan mcgregor   working in washington dc  in the humorous opening scene  he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down  using an array of hightech surveillance and communications equipment  he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office  the law firms employees get a good chuckle  the audience gets a good chuckle  the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman  ashley judd   there is something compelling about this mysterious woman  despite her glamorous looks  however  we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her  after the murders  she sobs while singing the christmas tune little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago  after each killing  she puts on a different wig  assumes a new name  and then makes her way to another state  the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions  but he does not alert the authorities  he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss  the eye  it turns out  also is haunted by his past  his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life  his tormented psyche creates a ghostlike image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation  she becomes a sort of spectral adviser  and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman  he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation  it doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders  and it doesnt matter that the eye is abnormally reticent  hiding his entire life behind computer screens  he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble  when a crazed druggie  jason priestley  attacks her  he shows up for some quick butt kicking  when the police are closing in to arrest her  he provides a distraction so that she can escape  all the while  the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight  peculiar  how bad is this movie  i refer you to my review quote source litmus test  just take a look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes  for this movie  they are from magazines called flaunt and mirabella   no doubt  they were impressed with judds series of catwalks and disguise changes  the major problem with eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward  always unsure of its ultimate destination  if it was a thriller  there was little to keep us entranced  if it was a love story  there was absolutely no emotional pull  completely disjointed in structure  its only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial  the one where the  on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a childs train set   i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents  beyond that  the film is hopelessly outofcontrol and is in need of seriously better traction and handling  ,0,1
25,i know that  funnest  isnt a word    fun  is a noun  and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  but thats the word that came to me right after viewing  chicken run   no wonder  this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions  like  that was the funnest movie ive ever seen   so to hell with websters   chicken run  is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while  i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner  the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something  living in a concentration camplike atmosphere  they are led by one plucky hen called ginger  voice of julia sawalha  who continually comes up with plans for escape  and always gets caught  subsequently spending day after day in the coal box  one night  a brash american rooster flies in over the fence  calling himself rocky  mel gibson   famous flying rooster and circus performer  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly  and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs  tweedy  miranda richardson  decides to abandon the farms eggselling plan for a pieselling plan  she orders a huge piemaking machine  cackling   chickens go in  pies come out   what sort of pies  chicken pies  of course  codirector nick park and his studio  aardman animation  produced three oscarwinning short films   creature comforts    the wrong trousers   and  a close shave   the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace  gromit  a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  part of what made the  wallace  films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new    the wrong trousers   for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and  a close shave  owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  but in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived  now teaming with codirector peter lord  park has created a similar creature in  chicken run   the plot is largely lifted from  the great escape   watch for a quick reference to the ballbouncing scene   with some spielberginspired action sequences providing the excitement  thing is  the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else   chicken run  feels fresh  alive  like nothing else ever done  part of it is the original idea  who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisonersofwar movie starring chickens  park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth  the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious  and to them  it is  but theyre  chickens   so its funny to us  another thing that helps  chicken run   and most of parks films  succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing  there are references to  the great escape   obviously  and  stalag    the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both  raiders of the lost ark  and  indiana jones and the temple of doom   theres even a nod to  the blues brothers   if you can believe it  and the filmmakers even get in a little lighthearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor  taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history  the  braveheart  reference is a hoot if you catch it  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one   chicken run  is downright brilliant in its execution  consider this  since july of last year  ive seen dozens upon dozens of  blair witch project  parodies  on television  on the radio  and online  out of all those  maybe one or two were amusing  the rest tiresome  why  because once you got past the thought that  theyre parodying that blair witch movie   most of the parodies had nothing to offer  no insight  no original idea  no greater purpose  they were only funny if you had seen the movie  otherwise  you got nothing  conversely   chicken run  doesnt lean on its parodies  the film references are never the sole focus of any scene  if youve never seen  indiana jones   the chase sequence is still fun  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character  park  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood  and as a result   chicken run  is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious  but not quite vague either  enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history  but if youve got it   chicken run  is that much richer  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances  and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them  ginger is perfect  spunky and opinionated  but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind  and julia sawalha  known as the cute mousy girl on  absolutely fabulous   nails it  she has warm  human chemistry with gibson  whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gungho veneer  the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived  but sweet  poor mr  tweedy  tony haygarth  suspects the chickens are organizing in some way  but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out  and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs  a hen that runs away with most of the best oneliners  all while perpetually crocheting a sweater   and two supplytrading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence  they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades  the chicken vs  egg dilemma  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of  chicken run   it comes as a delightful surprise  the film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens  the animation is firstrate  remember that this was all done the oldfashioned way  with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit  and you see just how truly remarkable  chicken run  really is  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great  precise and unwavering attention to detail  as in such topnotch family fare as  a bugs life  or  toy story     chicken run  has something to offer in nearly every frame  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes  but a active  attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details  anyway  the movies just a boatload of fun  funnest damn movie ive seen all year  ,1,1
26,an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer  you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage  which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder its hollywood existence  when i think of the screenwriters behind this film  i picture a room full of monkeys  the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves  all of the monkeys combine their efforts  hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clarks office  the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clarks desk while flailing his arms and shrieking  the director appears to be deep in thought  until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims i love it     the writing behind this project is embarrassing  for your amusement  i will explain the plot  dr  kinder  kathleen turner  and dr  heep  christopher lloyd  are two of the coldhearted executives at the baby geniuses institute  where peculiar studies are going on  as the story goes  there is an ancient myth explaining that babies  ages  and under  know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences  when they move past this phase  they become like any other drooling toddler  kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies  namely little sylvester  sly for short   who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission  impossible team  there is so much crap derived from this premise  despite the fact its virtually identical to the plot in look whos talking    a far superior film in any league   you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene  sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kungfu tactics  question  its obvious the babies are supersmart  but why are they able to fight like jackie chan   the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers  its a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes familiar home alone formula  i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless s knowledge  quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors  the effects in baby geniuses  similar to the talking animals in babe  are pathetic  the editing is a disaster  and the jokes are never funny  the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are cute  i suppose they are  i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute  other instances  though  i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script  there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever  their entire existence is based on punch lines  peter macnicol and kim cattrall  as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvesters twin  are both miscast  then again  i dont suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid  meanwhile  dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench  hahaha   i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs  instead of watching this  i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling  or perhaps you would consider going diving in sharkinfested waters  anything to avoid this painful movie  the final line in the film  spoken by the bratty sylvester  is if they think im doing the sequel for less than  mill  theyre nuts  sequel  please have mercy  ,0,0

29,synopsis  captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of   the baku  from the evil admiral dougherty and ruafro  the enterprise crew  in the meantime  experience the rejuvenating qualities of the baku homeworld  lt  worf grows a pimple  data sings opera pieces  picard scores with a baku chick  riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi  and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts  comments   star trek  the next generation  was a hugely successful sequel tv series to  star trek   a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the s  even though it still enjoyed high ratings   star trek  the next generation  ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original  star trek  s cast in paramounts film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise  star trek  insurrection is the ninth  star trek  movie and the third to focus on the  star trek  the next generation  crew  star trek  insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans  such as myself  would rate somewhere between  okay  and  good   after star trek v  the final frontier  a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant  star trek  voyager  tv series   star trek  fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise  i dont wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies  most people reading this probably havent followed  star trek  anyway  so a comparison would seem tedious at best  let me  thus  make my comparisons briefly so that its out of my system  star trek  insurrection is not as good as the previous installment  star trek  first contact  star trek  insurrections comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv  the voyage home  star trek ii  the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie  okay  lets move to the movie itself  star trek  insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise  humanitys exploration and colonization of space  with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners  this combination works well more often than it fails  but when it does fail  the humor really seems cheesy  much of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprises crew  audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times  star trek  insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the baku homeworld  forget the actors and special effects  the beautiful setting of this movie  with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys  steals the show  this tranquility  however  is broken by data  an android  who reveals to the baku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies  the sona  it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth  sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young  healthy state  the enterprise crew  led by captain picard  investigates datas actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the sona and an enterprise admiral to relocate the baku and plunder the planets youthrestoring properties  sound pretty heavy  it is  though this plot  anything but unique and groundbreaking  is undermined by the films constant barrage of humor  when going after data  for instance  picard sings an opera piece with him  this is supposed to be cute and humorous   in a much more funny sequence  work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the baku homeworld  a pimple which his crewmates  try as they might  cannot avoid looking at  the acting in star trek  insurrection is  for the most part  pretty good  since theyve been playing these characters for years  those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough  the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech  picards trademark  with his usual aplomb  brent spiner  another fine actor  plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film  though the old androidwishingtobehuman motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series   the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good  despite many other critics negative opinions  f  murray abraham  the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus  plays the major villain ruafro well enough  ruafro reminds me  somewhat  of the baron harkonnen in the  film version of dune  like the baron  ruafro continuously has his skin looked after  it is stretched and stapled by servants  in one particularly memorable scene  ruafro becomes very agitated  and his facial skin splits open and bleeds  ruafro is no khan from star trek iithe best trek villain everbut he is much better than the forgettable dr  soran from star trek  generations    okay  i promise  no more comparisons   donna murphy must also be noted as a baku woman  anij  who picard falls in love with  murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body  she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance  this is the type of woman whom picard  for those who know the character well  would be enchanted with  in fact  the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here  a particular plot point involving anijs ability to slow time down  an ability which she shares with picard  becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie  for as good as the actors and setting were  star trek  insurrections special effects were surprisingly disappointing  they proved adequate  sometimes barely  for a s mainstream science fiction film  but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars  the phantom menace  a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection   the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships  in particular  seemed trite and unsuspenseful  and the final confrontation between picard and ruafro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite  the new enterprise itself  only seen in this film and its predecessor  remains largely unexplored  though its exterior doesnt look quite right for a reason i cannot explain  despite star trek  insurrections frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects  i enjoyed the film  it maintains roddenberrys largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors  particularly star trek  first contact  though  dont get me wrong  the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully   id recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon  especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general  rated pg  i cant see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience  young or old  ,1,1
30,in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early s came this frenchcanadian coproduction by max fischer  the movie is set in paris where its hero  struggling american author david mirkine  judd nelson  at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity  suffers a terrible writers bloc  he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle  laurence treill   unfortunately  she hangs out in jet set circles  which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous  her connection with powerful david caravan  pierce brosnan  would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events  although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller  drama would probably be more appropriate genre label  pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers  and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments  low budget also becomes painfully visible  and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film  unfortunately  this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes  so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed  instead  they would have to settle with pointless  slow scenes involving nelson  brosnan and laurence treills attempts of serious acting  all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someones precious time  ,0,0
31,i love movies  i really do  every time i watch great movies like goodfellas    or raiders of the lost ark     a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent  skill and entertainment that is on display  even lower grade films such as the naked gun      or ghostbusters ii    while not exactly brilliantly well made  are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value  then theres my favourite martian  the exact opposite of what a movie should be  a hurried  poorly written and acted movie with one goal  to make money  disney  ever since the lion king    have lost their magic touch  but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk  christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t  v reporters tim ohara car  daniels   and soon tim finds the martian in his home  trying to recover and fix his spaceship  along with his zoot spacesuit  voiced by wayne knight  must fix his spaceship before it explodes  and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public  firstly by ohara  but later by rival t  v presenter brace channing  hurley   by calling himself tims uncle martin   laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events  but never does  many bad films have good intentions  but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment  filled to the brim with wham bang special effects  my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy  christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie  ive never seen a man pull a face for  minutes until now  jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless  his performance is incredibly lazy  although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives  darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever  but her role is somewhat  erm  limited  hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like a twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating  godawful performance in a moving picture   way to go liz  for the supporting cast  disney manage to assemble every character actor out there  during the film i was going he was the guy in    ah   er     before finally giving up and switching off  another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick   unfortunately  the writers  sherri stoner and deanna oliver  if anyone cares  forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be funny   instead  they deliver zoot  the martians deeply unfunny sidekick  although meant to be a manic character no doubt  every line that comes out of his neck is a dud  a real dud  citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester  even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character  not one child even bothered to smirk  its a nice special effect  though  another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves  or rather  the lack of them  my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour  it goes past the bowl  down the pipe and into the sewer  now  toilet humour can be funny  as dumb and dumber    humorously showed  but here  characters farting  belching and almost getting crapped on  literally  is not amusing   its insulting  theres one good gag right before the credits  but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued  either that  or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes  yes  men at work  yowza  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film  and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more  there are thousands of brilliant films out there that cant get distribution  yet trash like this gets released nationwide with ease  thankfully  as soon as it makes its money  it will never be seen again  and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie  down the toilet  ,0,0
32,set in the late s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis  who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie  less than zero   american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie  genre  that ellis helped to create  christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman  a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc  e and his colleagues  it seems that bateman is a serial killer and  unfortunately for his contemporaries  his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip  as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering coworkers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies  his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel  i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school  i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it  as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out  but i soon forgot about the novel and didnt end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore  i picked it up and read it  but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers  the movie has a similar effect  but at least its less cryptic than ellis novel  for once  a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on  both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations  down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses  but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout  the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in batemans impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does  as a result  the film is immensely more entertaining  lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films  having picked up kevin smiths catholicrattling dogma  and here with american psycho there is no difference  screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it  some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  thankfully  it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park  bigger  longer  uncut  side note   cowriter guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an illfated acquaintance of batemans who  after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute  proclaims that shes not a lesbian nor has any interest in it  the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner  the writerdirector of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy  is a lesbian  its a subtle injoke and its one i found to be pretty humorous  despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young upandcomers  including reese witherspoon   most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos  the real draw here is christian bale and his overthetop performance as patrick bateman  whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters  i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman  but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being  to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that hes as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger  one sequence in particular  involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song  hip to be square  right before burying an axe in a coworkers head  features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film  side note   despite the fact that huey lewis  hip to be square  and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film  dont expect to see them on the soundtrack release  huey lewis expressly requested that his song  featured in a rather large set piece in the film  much akin to the use of  stuck in the middle with you  in reservoir dogs   not be included on any soundtrack release  im assuming that collins requested the same  on a similar note  whitney houstons cover of  the greatest love of all  is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isnt the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source  apparently  houston wasnt as open about the use of her song as the others were  a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the films release  that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film  dont look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more  several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but im still undecided  there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops  old ladies  and cleaning staff with equal gusto  the scene seemed very dreamlike and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying  as an example  bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car   i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there  but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence  though comic  throws the film offbalance  which i suppose was the intention   other than the few flaws i have mentioned  american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film  although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in batemans reality   i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such  it may not change anyones life  but it will certainly have an effect  i know i will certainly hear  hip to be square  in a different context the next time i hear it  r ,1,1
33,eyes wide shut isnt the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubricks final film  but it is an impressive achievement  a mesmerizing  haunting  adult psychodrama about marriage  fidelity and sex  its a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end  consistently exhibiting the auteurs trademark penchant for long  continuous takes  his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast  indeed  eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot  kubrick  a renowned perfectionist  reportedly held his cast  hostage  on the set for nearly a year   in an uncharacteristic maneuver  kubrick cast two bigname stars in the lead roles  namely reallife husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman  they play bill and alice harford  a volatile couple who  during the course of a couple nights  ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other  he is an m  d   shes unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party  at the affair  they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else  when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman  after smoking a dash of weed  inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night  he  truthfully  says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with  they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story  evidently some time ago  she had a thing for a young naval officer  she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night  bill is jolted by alices story and we anticipate his reaction  but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go  show his face  at the house of a justdeceased patient  this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town  the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down  he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street  then  through a series of coincidences  he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic  and frankly  creepy  orgy takes place  with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other  erotic dread mounts as cruise  whos not supposed to be there  wonders the spacious halls watching the  action  until he is discovered to be an outsider  much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros  digitally edited the orgy scene  with the help of a computer  they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts  they can still be seen  just not in all their glory  in order to avoid the dreaded nc rating  european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it  roger ebert calls the american version the  austin powers version   and many others have bashed the alterations  i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scenes mystical atmosphere  the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks  this is an artful  distinctively gorgeous production  shot in dark  moody hues and featuring some elaborate  beautiful scenery  from the giant mansion used in the films centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harfords apartment  this film is always a pleasure to look at  to boot  a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still  at the core  behind the graphic  controversial content and unappealing mood  this is a goodnatured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity  it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic  its something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship  at the end  it seems  bills eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other  more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york  kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman  tom is completely convincing as dr  harford  a man who seems guided solely by destiny  with no control of the course his life will take  nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective  shes headed for an oscar nod  the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast  at the head of which is directorcumthespian sidney pollock  enigmatic and articulate as harfords mysterious friend  eyes wide shut is not perfect  the last hour could have used a slightly more scissorhappy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander  still  this is an important work from a great director  and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubricks best it is a worthy final film  a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness     eugene novikov  ,1,1

psychic link with a bigfootsized apecreature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine  and this rogainenightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl  meanwhile  a group of white  chainsmoking  guntoting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie  comments  watchers reborn  a cheaply made directtovideo turkey  is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers  technically  this should have been called watchers v  but it seems that this cycle of horror movies  much like many other sequelcrazy film series  has decided to drop the numbers from the titles    even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi   the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago  this really isnt a good movie  have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation  well  any hope a viewer may have had  perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill  will be dashed by the time hes seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn  theyre awful  these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer  some weird crap about a dead indian  teens  and wolves  and an  action  movie called detonator starring scott baio  scott baio  what idiot dreamed this movie up  after surviving these abysmal trailers  the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented  watchers reborn    maybe it wont be  that  bad  he may say to himself    perhaps  just perhaps  the bottomofthebarrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading  watchers reborn  after all  is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago  it stars mark hamill  luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  lou rawls is even in the mix   unfortunately  the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill  he looks very sick here   and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers  the book  the latter is really too bad  koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good  but he is still my favorite hack writer  koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful  people who read many of his books  however  often complain of repetitive plot devices  its definately not a koontz book if there isnt    a psychic     a superintelligent dog  or    a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs  watchers has all three devices  which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books  the idea behind koontzs novel  though highly implausible  is very interesting  basically  a biological war machine is created  a smart dog can be released in battle  track down its target  and then relay the targets position  psychically  to a large creature designed to kill in handtohand combat  silly but kind of neat too  im sorry  i dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn  the movie  i suppose i just dont want to talk about the movie itself  this turkey is really cheesy  no one in this movie can act  including mark hamill  and its difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero  the cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist  geneticist  zoologist  whateverthef   kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends  mercifully  the filmmakers opted not to do nudity  to be honest  the only halfconvincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein  you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts  i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie  and the creature  yes  the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling  this creature is shot about    times  but its okay  the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing  oh  he can also rip body parts off  allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around  cheesy gore  thats another main element of watchers reborn  it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the films campiness rather than its suspense  ultimately  i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror  scifi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the films silliness  though this film will tax even their patience  its an  minute film  but it feels like four hours   also  i hate to admit  i have survived far worse than this  anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin  fear the rush will know what i mean  finally  i couldnt help but think that watchers reborn would work well as  bot fodder  for the creative folks behind one of my alltime favorite shows   mystery science theater    this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face  rated r  watchers reborn contains dozens of bloodspattered bodies and unconvincing gore  it also has violence  obviously  i wouldnt recommend it for the little kids  but im sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay  instead of watching this film  however  i recommend reading koontzs book  trust me  itll be time much  much better spent  ,0,0
35,this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bonts debut as a director   surprise hit speed  but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead  annie  sandra bullock  is in the wrong place at the wrong time again  shes going on a cruise with her new boyfriend alex  jason patric   and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger  willem dafoe  who has a bone to pick with the shipping line  they sacked him after he got sick  now he wants the diamonds stored in the ships safe for compensation  that actually is the whole storyline  speed  could do without dialogues  the movie is all about images and remarkable sound  i dont really know why this is called an action movie  except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the ies  first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie  then desaster strikes  sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around  i looked for the  action  but couldnt find it  most of the time she is part of the decoration  the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door  now we know that she can handle a chain saw  we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds  the bomb defusal of course goes wrong  but only the furniture is damaged  not our heroes who still are needed  jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie  helping other passengers and frolicking in the water  his initial seasickness is suddenly gone  because there are ship  crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger  he does a pretty good job but i cant blame keanu reeves for declining this part  then theres willem dafoe  the villain  who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankensteins monster  he doesnt succeed  though  an untidy appearance isnt enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential  before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror  i cant really recommend speed   you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that arent meant to be funny  especially the showdown  when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat  there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie  in keeping with last years desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death  a really funny  and meant to be funny  scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision  some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie  had they looked out the window they wouldnt have missed the huge ship racing toward them  those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects  in an adequately equipped theater its as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate  but the ilm special effects cant save the movie  for all the money they could have done better  ,0,0

37,by the time dennis quaid  the ostensible star of switchback  makes his first appearance at about the minute mark  you may find yourself wondering why he bothered  after all  writerdirector jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines  the first finds amarillo  texas sheriff buck olmstead  r  lee ermey  facing a hotlycontested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction  as olmstead begins his investigation  we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects  lane dixon  jared leto  is an enigmatic young hitchhiker  bob goodall  danny glover  is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place  the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work  and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years  hes not supposed to be tracking him any more  according to the bureau  theyve got their man  but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise  two months earlier  lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer  and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere  lacrosse knows his killers work  and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game  it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence  but its a pretty good place to start  theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center  as a dramatic actor  dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tightjawed  sourpuss pucker  we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwoodesque rasp  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character  pulling the audience into his haunted intensity  making switchback his film  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated  its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes  even without quaid  it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy  building our curiosity over which man  the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor  is the real threat  unfortunately  stuart tips his hand far too early in the game  both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal  once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched  the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable  in fact   stale and predictable  describes the direction that switchback takes in general  falling back on fartoocommon hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere  a climactic fistfight on board a freight train  and edgy law enforcement agents  its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead  far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film  played with atypical restraint by r  lee ermey  hes a wonderful  unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a filmmaker willing to take a few risks with his casting and storytelling  instead  stuart places his trust in a  name  star who cant carry the material  maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script  the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story  ,0,0

39,the word to describe sharon stone is  wonder   not that she is a wonder  but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent  she has a dynamic screen presence in  basic instinct   turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in  casino   but possesses neither of those here  stone teams up with private school headmasters wife isabelle adjani to kill adjanis thoroughly unlikable husband  chazz palminteri   in a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock  as in homage to read  steal from     it turns out that someone saw them or hes not dead or maybe    kathy bates turns in a credible  if unspectacular  performance as an investigative police detective  her character is a bit dull but realistic  although her actions at the end are puzzling  adjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation  its stone that is a disappointment among the actors  how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one  costumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone  she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring  not enticingly dangerous  even the threat  or promise   of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out  on the positive side  there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive  that is if you can put up with stones cardboard cutout character and scenes directly lifted from hitchs movies  ,0,0

41,unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop  theres the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain  the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys  the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film  bo dietl  pronounced deedle  baldwin  is one tough cop  a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia  on top of that problem  he has a drunk  gambling addicted partner  penn  who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets  i guess cops arent immune    then  throw into the mix the femme fatale  gershon   right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama  but right in the middle of the film  they throw in a completely unrelated plot point  dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from  the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death  once the case is solved  the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue  whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably  aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso  an insult if you ask me  the performances were pretty good  baldwin  though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec  does a fine job as one tough cop  penn  who also slips into an impression of his brother sean  is even better as a loser tough guy cop  what one tough cop lacks is originality  this film offers nothing new  nothing that you cant get from any cop film  it screams sidney lumet all over the place  perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman  producers of lumets dog day afternoon and serpico  but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film  too much else is lacking  i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture  something that i almost never notice  but once i saw that  i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot  at times  i was hoping to see it  one tough cop isnt laughable  nor is it a terrible film  but it just isnt unique  it is a classic example of a film that didnt need to be made  but one thing is for sure  it could really use a better title  ,0,0
42,there was probably a good reason that the warner bros  studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened  and  after seeing this piece of toxic waste  i now know why  this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago  fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in gods country  somewhere in eastern kentucky  its beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate  kris kristopherson  who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role   it turns out that hes filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit  seagal plays jack taggert  an aikidoversed  fighting machine  who is an agent with the epa  no    not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa  its the environmental protection agency  i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice  written by someone named jeb  i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships  banjopicking preachers  and dumbasnails rednecks  but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in  seagals idea of a disguise is a longlength  leather jacket  but to get closer to the kinfolk  he will fix peoples porches for free  thats another great epa asset  teaching agents how to fix porches  slow and plodding  this project is a total mess  the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige  here  his bravado basically turns into bullyness  townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued  fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever  and his soap box message wears thin within the first  minutes  the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony  gets behind the pulpit  and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment  but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping  kristopherson  meets up with seagal  kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away  seagal gallantly replies   ill leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth   i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background  this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagals righteousness and narcissistic arrogance  seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace  that of the envirothriller  on deadly ground   however  the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this  still  i believe in preserving mother earth  so save your  and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity  ,0,0
43,in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the reallife incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa  the twilight murders  another one from the series  is dealing with the case of gordon kahl  played by rod steiger   old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u  s  government  after being released  he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest  when the u  s  marshals come to arrest him  it turns out that kahl isnt alone  many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist antigovernment beliefs  and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that  that brings fbi on the scene  and agent mayberly  michael gross  is supervising the manhunt  however  his efforts seem fruitless  since kahl still has many supporters  some of them even in the local law enforcement  after betrayed   thriller by costa gavras  hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising rightwing extremism in the american northwest  and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing  when media hype brought rightwingers back into spotlight  until that time  only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon  unfortunately  the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film  that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script  sometimes  like many american tv movies  it creates drama where drama shouldnt be  on the other hand  film is steadily directed by dick lowry  and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl  on the other hand  michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible  however  film does deal with potentially thoughtprovoking social and political issues  so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldnt be the total waste of time  ,0,1
44,its ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original directors cut of the film  films such as aliens  the abyss  the wild bunch  blade runner  and terminator  are all prime examples of a filmmakers integrity  later chopped up or mucked with by the studio  the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films  the dvd release of the original international version of luc bessons  masterpiece the professional  which is known as l  on around the world  is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a directors cut  for years  i have heard of an  international  version available only in laserdisc format  which has eluded me for years  i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for  bucks just to watch certain directors cuts  including l  on  but after countless searches in laserdisc stores  i could never find it  until now  the film follows the story of l  on  played by jean reno  a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello  he lives next door to a ferociously independent yearold girl named mathilda  played by then newcomer natalie portman  whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops  one day  a crew of the cops  lead by gary oldman in an overthetop performance  kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries  taking pity on her  l  on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life  mathilda learns of l  ons hit man profession and decides to follow in l  ons footsteps as a  cleaner   she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l  on he has kept locked away as part of his profession  at this point  the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in  the international version contains an additional  minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l  on and mathilda  footage that american censors deemed  too explicit   i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle  the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathildas and l  ons motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops  theres even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jeanhugues anglade  star of queen margot  bessons la femme nikita  and killing zoe  with these additional scenes replaced  l  on and matildas relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version  the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes  the film becomes primarily a heavy  emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film  the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema  my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional  throw down twenty bucks  and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece  directorwriter  luc besson producer  luc besson  claude besson starring  jean reno  natalie portman  gary oldman  danny aiello ,1,1
45,ive never been a member of the robin williams fan club  a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way  and i sometimes feel as though im watching a yearold class clown  in his films  williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchyfeely emotion  leading to wildly uneven performances  mrs  doubtfire seemed readymade for the same problems  but instead it proves to be williams best comic screen project yet  while it still contains some characteristic selfindulgence  mrs  doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging bellylaugh comedy served up with high energy  williams stars as daniel hillard  a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior  one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda  sally field   and she files for a divorce  unemployed  living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children  daniel decides to respond to mirandas ad for an afternoon housekeeper  he turns to his brother frank  harvey fierstein   a theatrical makeup artist  and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire  a matronly yearold englishwoman  daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on mirandas flirtation with a wealthy client  pierce brosnan   to spend time with the children  and to learn something about responsible parenting  all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best  mrs  doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work  and basically it does so  the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel  and thanks to the fantastic special makeup thats instantly believable  it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film  making dustin hoffmans dorothy michaels look like milton berle  more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell  its a bit hard to swallow that she doesnt recognize any of the voices as her husbands  perhaps the biggest contrivance were asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs  doubtfire in a few minutes  theres more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask  fortunately  these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll  during the film  i was generally too busy laughing  after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams riffing  mrs  doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place  daniels frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful  as is the climactic restaurant sequence  even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away  clearly  most of the credit for doubtfires success goes to robin williams  it took putting him in drag  but for once he plays a comic character that isnt just robin williams with a different name  he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire  and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foulmouthed  wisely  he never aims for saintly  his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty  but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity  its one of mrs  doubtfires charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect  just people trying to be better  as miranda  sally field is solid in a background role  and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu  the children are also good  although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest  the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing  its easy to see mrs  doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over  and its true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common  but mrs  doubtfire manages to carve out its own space  particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judges decision and the ultimate status of daniel and mirandas relationship  theres nothing dazzlingly new in mrs  doubtfire  but there are plenty of laughs  and good comedies are always in short supply  and its nice to see robin williams just act for a change  ,1,1
46,numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past scifi  suspense thrillers  soldier is a multi  crossbreed between the likes of terminator  aliens and offspring  the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel  not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground  besides this  the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age  the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured  slow and sluggish  and could have done with better choreography  russell who is usually a good actor in bgrade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character  sergeant todd  who seems more like a sergeant toad  besides having almost no dialogue  his character appears stunted  zombielike which is in line with his screen persona  but scores little points of empathy with the audience  this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson  whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth  although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former  it is still a long way from anything considered desirable  ,0,0
47,alexander dumas the three musketeers is one of the most oftenadapted literary works  and for good reason  the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story  perhaps the musketeer  a new film that  reimagines  the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix  is one adaptation too many  its just awful  spiritless  silly and unforgivably boring  transforming the timeless classic into a mishmash of oldastime clich  s and incoherent  repetitive action sequences  this time  dartagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers  who cant even pronounce his characters name  as a boy  he watched his father get killed by febre  tim roth   a lackey of powerhungry cardinal richelieu  he vowed to have vengeance  after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman  he goes looking for his enemy  on his quest  he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government  the royal musketeers have lost their gusto  what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinals own guards  only a few loyal swashbuckers remain  among them athos and portos  who are only figureheads in this movie   together with dartagnan  they fight to extricate the queen  catherine deneuve  from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant  oh  and as an afterthought  dartagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn  mena suvari   just thought id mention that  now  look  i dont know whose idea this was  but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tonguelashing  i have nothing against  modernizing  classic works of literature  at the very least  they can inspire viewers to actually read the book  but films as dull as this have no positive side effects  director peter hyams  known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days  has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas masterwork  the sense of excitement  cause  and camaraderie  instead  we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous  uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing  when the musketeers finally get to holler  all for one  and one for all   i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt  maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyamss tone  which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the readers digest condensed version of the story that he gives us  its as though anything that may have been construed as  fun  was purposely expunged from the production  the joylessness of the proceedings  from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes  can be felt in every frame  chambers cant act  suvari  roth and deneuve can  but arent given the chance  and when push comes to shove  the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious  though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit  some movies seem sloppy and careless  clearly made for a quick buck  with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful  the film is intricate  stylish and precise  hitting the wrong note every single time  ,0,0
48,my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled  dragnet  reruns off the air  sure  id seen them all at least once  but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv  even though  dragnet  is out of circulation at the moment  we webb antifans still have the d  i   a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous  blue boy  episode of  dragnet   for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness  think of the d  i  as what would happen if sgt  joe friday ever enlisted  because he plays exactly the same character here  a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded  melodramatic speeches on any topic  in this election year  im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up  the  produced and directed by jack webb  card pretty much goes without saying  this is his movie all the way  and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason  i was wondering if there would even be a plot  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants  but the d  i  gives us more  much more  webbs mission is to make a man out of private owens  the local screwup  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or  the captain will  personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself     whether the  lace panties  part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered   this  of course  gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell  for those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching  heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his  i cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper  but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about      now you listen to me  youngster  someday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness    ive got a headline for you  every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours  youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there   i couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d  i    nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame   but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines  like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar  where he orders a tomato juice   he meets a woman who  coincidentally  also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival  another marine d  i  webb marches over to the table  gets up in her face and says   just what kind of a dame do you think you are   bogart he aint  the other d  i  gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl   hes a damn good d  i      i guess im just a little jealous   join the club  were all jealous of jack webbs way with women  which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene  as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment  a lingerie store  and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display    you expect me to talk to you    in here    he exclaims  no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras  the woman goes off to help a customer  leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen  a little girl spots him in the store and demands   what are you doing in here    youre a man  arent you   he doesnt reply  but you know hes thinking in his head   what an odd species of human  so small  must be one of those children everyones been talking about   this poor girl  scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb  would later swear off the male gender entirely  just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for  the movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance  it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie  where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea  webb asks owens   was that flea you killed a male or female   owens replies   a male  sir   webb yells to the platoon   this aint the one   that such a scene  along with the rest of the movie  was intended to be taken seriously defies comment  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d  i   but for iwo jima  guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie  with the exception of owens  were played by actual marines  someone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did  it makes it all the more ironic  like raeeyain on your wedding day  that the man had no sense of humor himself  theres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter  webb bursts in the room and shouts   what did i tell you about laughing    to which the private replies   sir  only nineyearold girls laugh  sir   and let me tell you  i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie  ,0,0
49,inspired by the  film house on haunted hill starring vincent price  directed by william malone  starring geoffrey rush  famke janssen  and chris kattan  rated r  contains violence  profanity  and brief nudity   synopsis  eccentric millionaire price offers      to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium  the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment  an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients  comments  house on haunted hill is based upon the original  film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price  in an obvious homage  the millionaires name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have  this is a pretty bad horror film  yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining  and house on haunted hill is just such a film  it is  surprisingly  better than another recent haunted house remake  the haunting  a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson  the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face  house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a bmovie  years old and makes no illusion that its a crappy horror movie  thus  somehow  it proves slightly more successful  i cant think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast  it is this cast which lifts this hohum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror  price  the main character  is played by geoffrey rush  the academyaward winning actor of shine  rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry  a spiral reminiscent of ben  ghandi  schindlers list  kingsleys ridiculous appearance in the camp scifi classic species  i dont know why  but sometimes its entertaining to see  quality  actors in bad movies  more surprises  rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure  rather lamely too   and singer lisa loeb    appears as a tv news reporter  the highlight of the cast  however  has to be saturday night live member chris kattan  kattans comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium  while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to whats exactly going on  the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense  a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too  house on haunted hill  i suspect  has just about left the secondrun theaters  its worth catching on cable next year  if you get a chance  if you have a choice  pick this movie over the haunting  its the better of two evils  you could say  though  more appropriately perhaps  itd be better to say that its the better of two turkeys  ,0,0
50,what were they thinking  nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough  but do we really need an eighties film  robbie hart  adam sandler  used to want to be a rock and roll star  but in  hes singing at weddings and having a good time  a romantic at heart  he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie  when she leaves him waiting at the altar  his tune changes to  love stinks   he meets waitress julia  drew barrymore  who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together  in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie  sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role  but there is no spark  barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it  beauty but no attitude  both characters are just there  bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show  the eighties are shoved in our face  references to deloreans  madonna   dallas   ivana and donald  burt and loni and  miami vice  get old fast  the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions  theyre not funny and it doesnt work  with change on all fronts accelerating more and more  nostalgia appears to have a great appeal  but dont you think we could have more than  years before we yearn for the past  maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino    michael redman has written this column for over  years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be   ,0,0
51,anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases      especially hercules     emotion  all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences arent going to hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together  not since disneys beauty  the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works  the story of the romanov family  the rulers of russia  and their downfall begins the film  anastasia  one of the daughters  narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin  voiced by christopher lloyd  with her grandmother  voiced by angela landsbury   but anastasia gets lost  and grows up with no memory of her royal origins  the grandmother lives in paris  hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia  the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution  a young woman named anya  voiced by meg ryan  runs across dimitri  john cusack  and vlad  kelsey grammar   who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money  they pick anya to pose as their princes  and of course  it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia  dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner  and meanwhile  rasputin is not dead  and plots his revenge against the last romanov  the plot is actually quite well structured  there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later  but it moves along fast enough that theyll never have time to be bored  what this really means is that the adults wont be bored by it either  there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny  and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses  there is  of course  lots of comedy for the kids  including rasputins pet bat  bartok  hank azaria   who is easily the funniest thing in the film  however  the comical scenes never distract from the drama  but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly  the animation is gorgeous  the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators  not since beauty  the beast have animated characters had so much life to them  even without the voices  they act  the musical number in paris is a showstopper  with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style  as with all recent animated features  there are songs  however  these songs do more than just provide fodder for top singers to get on the radio  although there are three of them during the end credits   the songs are all very catchy  and advance the plot  instead of just being showpieces  except for the paris number  but thats so much fun  its okay      i cant reccomend anastasia highly enough  its a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics  kids and adults alike will enjoy it  and its also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney  ,1,1

53,its no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office  a poorlywritten script can be bested by a superb acting corps  and a wellwritten piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs  in directing his latest actioncomedy  director brett ratner  money talks  takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all getout buddy cop movie  in addition  rush hour serves as a firstclass example of directing a movie with conservative attitude  a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types  the two lead names share equal screen time here  mostly because they spend it together  jackie chan  in his first completely american production  makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts  the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago  knock off  stands no chance against the content of this one  chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise  and theres no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldnt believe their eyes the first time  chris tucker  on the opposite side  relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chans performance  he works perfectly with the script  and its quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines  almost essential to the action genre  the plot is nonexistent  were quickly introduced to detective james carter  tucker  is a maverick officer for the lapd  cut forward to another scene where the daughter  julia hsu  of the american chinese consul  tzi ma  is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters  the fbi is quick to the rescue  but the consul insists that one of his men  detective inspector lee  chan   be brought on the case to help  the fbi resists  but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective  its here that carter and lee hook up  and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up  rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up  but it doesnt quite reach the top tier of actioncomedies like last years grosse pointe blank  there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to  and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan  this might be a major drawback  also  some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride  and others are there simply to look menacing  however  none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background  almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another  whether its tuckers toneddown routine or chans tight rein on his action sequences  and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types  a recommendable visit to the theater  indeed  ,1,1

58,urban legend surprised me  based on the last few films the genre has produced  including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer  disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween  h   i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena  thankfully  legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip  scary and stylish entertainment  but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  youre all familiar with the plot  a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac whos identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be  you guessed it  everybodys favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks    the only person you didnt suspect  however  just because legend doesnt really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant qualify as firstclass entertainment  it was  believe it or not  one of the funnest times ive had at the movies all year  the thing is  im not really sure what made this particular stab  pardon the pun  at the genre seem so fresh and alive  maybe it was the abovepar performances by the movies two leads  jared leto and  cybil  actress alicia witt   or  it could have been the on target direction by jamie blanks  more likely  though  it was because of the inspired premise  i dont think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener  not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when  gasp   a gas problem  heehee  forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill  one problem  though  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif  i thought not  predictably  the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company  its odd  though  when you pick up a phone to realize that nobodys on the other line  naturally  the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off  and the when we least expect it    whack    a decapitation  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car  so who is it this time  the obvious candidate is the slightly offkilter professor at the college the girl went to  none other than freddy kruger himself  robert englund   who teaches a class on urban legends  aha  or could it be the famehungry local journalist  leto  looking for a meaty story to put on his resume  like all movies of this nature  one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit  and it turns out to be  of course  the one you didnt suspect  im not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is  but i must give credit where credit is due  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been    fun    complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi  ca ,1,0
59,  id rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell   earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher  with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister  hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story  he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american  and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation  from elmer gantry on  we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church  well  think again  for the apostle  which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade  does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister  and by implication all  the rest of organized religion  instead it gives us a highly devout man  who certainly has his foibles  but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god  and arguably just as surprising  the goodspirited film is no comedy  even if it does have humorous moments  instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures  when in the privacy of his attic  robert duvall  as texas preacher euliss  sonny  dewey  argues sternly with his lord  the scene shares a kinship with emily watsons character crying out for her god in breaking the wavess most powerful scene  the body of the story starts with sonnys coming upon an horrific auto accident  which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters  with his well worn bible in hand  sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accidents dying victims  the scowling police officer orders him to go away  and  after he has tried to work his miracles  sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lords work  robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the films director  writer  executive producer  and chief financier  rarely has a movie been such a labor of love  with a white suit  peachcolored shirt and tie  and dark sunglasses  sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher  duvall has every movement down pat  even when he is walking down the street  the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy  he dances and claps all the way  sonnys churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deepvoiced black orators  but his rhetoric is always competitive    i may be on the devils hitlist  but im on gods mailing list   he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent  and they lap it up  people jump up  scream   praise the lord   and mean it  the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable  but sonny is no saint  it turns out that he has a wandering eye  which angers his wife jessie  played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the churchs youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonnys church  leaving him unemployed  sonny  letting his temper get the best of him  does something foolish  which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever  the bulk of the film occurs in a small  predominately black church in louisiana  which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church   one way road to heaven  holiness temple   with an enthusiastic flock  in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e  f  the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church  he asks his members to tithe  but he gives all of his money  and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks  a man who cant stand to be still  he tells one of his friends   i quit school because i didnt like recess   in his new town he meets toosie  miranda richardson   who  like him  has a family that she hasnt seen in a while  his romance with the separated woman  like the rest of the film  doesnt follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies  billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker  his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of shows many surprising scenes  again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take  although it probably couldnt have ended any other way  the movie does wrap things up nicely  and dont miss the sweet epilogue during the films closing credits  a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film  the apostle runs a little too long at     it is rated pg for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up  ,1,1
60,for a good ten years or so  super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene  now  he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo   who launched chows super stardom in the acclaimed a better tomorrow  by moving to hollywood  i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them  chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt  his final job requires him to kill a policemans seven year old boy  this he refuses do and runs  however  he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job  cue around  minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot outs which take place in various locations  some thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring  the car wash scene  i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked  tut tut  the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music   i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie  and not on the content  mia sorvino  a passport forger  is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun  director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chows excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots  chows trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale  which in fairness is quite good  and theres not even a toothpick in site  and as for making chow shoot like a cop  well thats damned unforgiveable  to round up  the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow  it would appear he has left asia for a  minute pop video  this is not what we wanted at all  considering john woo was the exec producer    did he have no say so at all   watch the killer again and weep at the difference  review by chris hill    theres room at the top  they are telling you still  but first you must learn how to smile as you kill  if you want to be like the folks on the hill   ,0,0
61,the second jackalbased film to come out in   the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal   this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland  and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter  concordia university in montreal  canada  the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal  but does not pretend to be  factual  plot  naval officer ramirez  quinn  gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal  in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities  he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee  ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this  assignment   and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism  intrigue and doublepersonality syndrome  which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states   critique  great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to twohour runtime  admittedly  i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film  and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand  but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments  as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line  the first hour is mostly just a buildup of things to come  and does offer a great characterization of the jackal  but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending  quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal  but didnt offer anything extraordinary  in my opinion  sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late  but nonetheless  appeared to relish the coldheartedness of their chosen characters  i didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick  but then again  she doesnt show up in most of the film  so that wasnt so bad  i did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision  this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences  but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer  i thought that was neat  having said that  i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was  and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the  fake  jackal met with the  real  jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part  but all in all  not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre  little known facts  ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji  he stands     was born in scarborough  england  and won the best actor honor in s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi  many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal  canada  joblos haven of restfulness   donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland  is canadian  and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal  ,1,1
62,i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles  first  let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie  the producers are not stupid  making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable  you have to reach for a larger audience  therefore  the movie is quite userfriendly  altough  nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange  but fear not  duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera  in any case  the answer is no  i am not a fan of the xfiles  i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium  however  since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie  i am glad to report that i learned nothing new  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie  warning  major spoilers follow  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie  you must not be able know what is coming  what exactly is over that hill and what that weird  hummm  sound is all about  you have been warned  the xfiles is what a summer should be  exciting  scary  great special effects  unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary  and good performances  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank  from start to finish  this movie does not let go of you  when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be  take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon  this flick is scary  not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  in fact  the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid  you know  when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair  or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt  so yeah  the xfiles is scary  and guess what  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed  computer generated  babyzilla  it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster  do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie  in fact  the creature is there for maybe three minutes total  no  the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series  scully is at his side  of course  but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny  but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much  no  this is mulders time in the spotlight  by now  you have heard of the scene where mulder  showers  independence day  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you  lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be  showering  godzilla instead  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there    who cares   if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill  the script is spotless  every thing that happens happens for a purpose  if you are confused by something  do not worry because it will all become clear later on but  and i cannot stress this enough  pay attention    unlike most summer movies  the dialogue is twice as important as the effects  miss one vital piece of information and  like most people who talk during movies  you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense  also  to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies    dont  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because  again unlike most summer movies  godzilla anybody    the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots  every scene is crucial and serves a purpose  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a  big emotional scene  between godzilla attacks  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie  the xfiles is  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited  cool effects  its got some  pulse pounding  hell yes  strangely enough  i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time  it does not provide answers to the shows many questions  the status quo remains nearly the same and  no  mulder and scully do not get together  rating  four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer  several jump right out of your seat thrills  many  whoah  i never saw that one coming   moments  four  holy shit  where the hell did that come from  and one heck of an ending  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star  well  i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck  the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop  its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that

63,after a stylistic detour with mrs  parker and the vicious circle  which  despite its uncomfortable tone  was close to being a conventional movie   director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow  a romantic black comedy about love  betrayal  and selfabsorption  while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture  rudolphs atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing  if not always pleasant  movie  it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director  meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it  until mrs  parker  i had not been overly impressed by his movies  i found equinox  his last pre mrs  parker effort  to be irritating and frustrating  i was somewhat surprised  therefore  to discover that i liked afterglow  there are several reasons for this  but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident  mannered aspects of his approach  the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems  the story is absorbing  and the acting is topnotch  in short  rudolph has created a world that its worth spending two hours in  afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples  jeffrey byron  jonny lee miller  is a cold  seeminglyheartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife  marianne  lara flynn boyle   for her part  marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level  all shes interested in is seducing him during those few days when shes ovulating  after he refuses to make love  she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor  the other couple  lucky  nick nolte  and phyllis mann  julie christie   are an older pair  but theyre no more content than jeffrey and marianne  a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart  they remain married as a matter of convenience  but  since phyllis wont allow lucky to touch her  they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs  the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable  the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey  the two of them are immediately attracted to one another  and it doesnt take long before theyre lounging together  naked  in her pool  meanwhile  jeffrey  who is captivated by older women  runs into phyllis in a hotel bar  is smitten  and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains  the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love  sex means something different to everyone  to jeffrey  its an unpleasant chore  a loss of control  to marianne  its a means to a maternal end  to lucky  its an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles  and to phyllis  its a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness  ultimately  none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves  the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script  but in the performances  jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish  callous  suitandtie businessman  those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity  lara flynn boyle  who wasnt impressive in rudolphs equinox  is greatly improved  making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability  nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky  and he manages to deliver some of rudolphs most pregnant lines with practiced ease  the clear standout  however  is julie christie  who is nothing short of delicious as the worldweary phyllis  her often wry  occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the films humor  and theres hardly ever a moment when she doesnt steal the spotlight from her costars  i dont know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph detractors  but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the directors earlier productions  enough of his trademark style remains  however  to reassure his supporters  afterglow is basically a fourpronged character study  the plot is not especially compelling  but the character interaction is  and thats the real reason to see this motion picture  rudolph has painted an able picture of the nonromantic side of love  the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction  ,1,1
64,robin williams has the rarest of gifts  the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style  overwhelmingly  his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best  with the notable exception of flubber   so when i  the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams  tell you that not even williams can save his latest project  you know its in trouble  jakob the liar is a confused  muddled little movie  a generically  uplifting  film with a fundamental contradiction  the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesnt realize it  williams plays jakob haim  a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii  one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a highranking german officer for his punishment  jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately  seconds of a radio broadcast  the announcement  in english  but punctuated by a triumphant  heil hitler    is that russian troops are only miles away from jakobs ghetto  liberation  he thinks  the next day  jakob tells the news to his closest friend  a volatile prize fighter named misha  liev schreiber   who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along  soon  it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home  a crime punishable by death  this is absurdly false  but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this  the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate  the danger  of course  is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto  and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger  in a curiously irrelevant subplot  jakob finds a year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home  apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered  and goes to great length to make sure of that  just why the idea frightens him is never made clear  he and the girl build an uninvolving  generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning  the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine  but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false  such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations arent met  the results are far worse than if there was no hope  thats the films biggest detriment  it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false  its never moving because it doesnt give us anything to be moved by  jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing  robin williams doesnt inject the film with life  as a matter of fact  he seems a little out of it  as if crippled by his fake accent  he is stragely unenthusiastic  his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless  hopeless  not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent  this isnt the robin williams we know and love  in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it  here  he is more of a wannabe serious actor  an impostor  jakob the liar will be compared with last years life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a  holocaust comedy   its not a comedy  it tries  sometimes  but it rarely works  is it a melodrama  a war movie  a character study  no  no  and no  jakob the liar is the kind of movie that cant be placed into a category  not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts  ,0,1
65,by phil curtolo mel gibson  braveheart  gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom  gibson plays tom mullen  a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath  played by gary sinise  forrest gump   and his band of lowlife thugs kidnap his only son for  million  tom and his wife  kate  played by rene russo  tin cup  were instructed not to inform the police  but they contacted the fbi  minutes later  an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo  broken arrow  are in toms house and wiring every phone  the plot sounds average  just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen  and it was nothing more than that  that is until about halfway through the movie  suddenly  tom goes to the fox  news room and makes a live broadcast saying   this is your ransom  but this is as close as you will ever get to it  instead  i am offering this money as a reward on your head  dead or alive   at this point  the plot thickened  and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspensefilled action film with great stunts  the last half of the film is very well done  another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise  as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie  owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject   it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones   before this movie  sinise played mostly  good guys   first in of mice  men  then in forrest gump  and most recently  in apollo   but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a copgonebad  gibson  of course  was just being gibson  in an oscarworthy performance  although most of the scenes were quite predictable  ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film    ,1,1
66,  six days  seven nights  is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right  a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare  heres a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows its fluff  recognizes its fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff  of course  the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movies success  ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that its easy to forget what a funny guy he can be  as his female counterpart  anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet  goofily charismatic performance  the age difference  fords   heches   matters not  these two click in a charged way thats hard to come by  the story is a nobrainer  ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris  while heche is careerminded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe  robin  on a tropical vacation with fianc  frank  david schwimmer   gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti  so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there  the plane crashes during a terrible storm  and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization  a series of unpleasant  often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other  meanwhile  back at the resort  frank is tempted himself by quinns shapely female tagalong  jacqueline obradors   that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinnrobin pairing  and while it makes for a few good laughs early on  it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin  and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways  this flaw is only a minor inconvenience  director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk  at a slim  minutes   six days  seven nights  never wears out its welcome  where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title  michael brownings clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable oneliners  my favorite  taken in context  is  you mean arrrgh pirates     and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another  theyre all quite engaging  even the movies more  serious  moments are played with a wink  heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the  believability  of  six days  seven nights   heterosexual pairing    so shes a lesbian  so what  deal with it   of course it doesnt  and here  her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way  in fact  her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click  these opposites attract with the utmost  endearing electricity  at one point  when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest  heche asks ford how old he is  after several wrong guesses   fortyfive  fifty     he whispers his age to her    you still look good   heche stammers    i still am good   ford replies  shes good too  and together  they make  six days  seven nights  one memorable ride  ,1,1
67,let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal  so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal  i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times  under no circumstances  should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix  this theater  owned by the parent company of one of hollywoods biggest studios  hasnt even graduated into stereo sound yet  the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age  in other words  the sound sucked  as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater  bad sound doesnt do anything to add to a film  im not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together  there  ive had my rant  now on with the regularly scheduled review  which sadly wont include commentary on the films sound which im assuming was spectacular  but im just guessing  my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix  it is nothing short of stunning visually  sadly  the rest of the film  while pretty good  doesnt quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good  the matrix has at its core a good concept  although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked  keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax  it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster  now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator  plugged into a computer network  the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed  the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose  that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons  they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie  reeves character  neo  is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus  laurence fishburne   newcomer carrieanne moss and one of hollywoods most underrated actors  joe pantoliano  join fishburne in the band of freedomfighters  the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular  this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actors extensive preproduction training in martial arts  this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film  when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world  it all adds up to an eyeful  as i already said  the visuals far outpace the rest of the film  acting in the matrix is not bad  but it certainly isnt real good either  keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances  although to his credit  it is one of his better performances  laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a scifi action film  more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama  joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had  carrieanne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role  its nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks  you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film  it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences  i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue  which was terrible at times  in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird  it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie  so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about  thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability  my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending  the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before  the ending itself was just plain strange  the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch  while the rest of the film  acting  dialogue and to a degree plot  detract from the high production values  they dont detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening  ,1,0
68,plot  two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family  which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover  the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one  when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them  they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma  critique  ive been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now  but hold on to your brooms and incantations  cause this puppy is far from being it  for a film that has the word  magic  in its title  this movie contains very few moments of magic    or humor for that matter  drama  suspense  or romance  well actually  there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled  it never lets you in on whether its a comedy  a drama  a horror show  or a murder mystery  or maybe its a romance  eh  it doesnt really matter  cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting  that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them  or the film as a whole  if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack  this film mightve had a chance to be more than what it is now  which is an unentertaining  crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grabbag of stupid voiceovers  overdone songs  melodramatic romance  undeveloped story and uneven acting  i only wish that i could make that one hour and fortyfive minutes of my life reappear  but alas  it is lost in the spiritual world of  interesting ideas gone wildly awry   little known facts about this film and its stars  this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman  coscreenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for s batman  robin  director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours  ,0,0
69,capsule  lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness  potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring  claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze  just to break the ice  its a perfect example of what my wife calls an s  f  e  movie  where s  f  e  means so f    ing earnest  movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing  claire is one strained speech after another  written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk  claire takes two women  claire and noel  both writers  and throws them together in the same cabin at a womenonly writers retreat  claire wrights light comedy  while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior  obviously  the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about  and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie  thats all they do  talk  the movie sets up its  microscopic  plot with beatadeadhorseintoglue obviousness  the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie  a selfprofessed lesbian  and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian  claire looks like shes been hit with a sockful of wet sand  the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance  and claire looks out over the water reflectively    ugh   the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads  all of this  of course  leads up to a scene of complete inevitability  claire and noel  in a scene that should have come an hour earlier  because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about whats just happened  we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone  only how they felt about things that didnt even happen yet  the problem with claire    is not lesbianism as such  but the leaden way its handled  why is it that any  serious   a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful  examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie thats unwatchably boring  the way this movie deals with lesbianism  we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids  many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better  more engaging  more creative  more intellectually and artistically interesting  look at john sayles lianna  or the interesting and littleseen desert bloom  both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire  what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants  ,0,0
70,contact  pg  theres a moment late in robert zemeckiss contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place  we see a scientist  dressed in a silvery space suit  walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact  spherical space pod  unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops  anticipation  excitement  anxiety  fearthe audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character  nervously  breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead  it is this sense of discovery  the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration  that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical  captivating entertainment  jodie foster stars as dr  ellie arroway  a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals  and i mean lifeafter losing her entire family when she was young  the only thing occupying ellies world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth  after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers  ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega  which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport  from this synopsis  contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact  but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the scifi hook  the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe  but perhaps more than anything else  contact is a character study of ellie  whose obsession with empirical  scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power  the irony is that  while admitting to having no religious faith  she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes  in a sense  a religion in its own right  it would be easy for scripters james v  hart and michael goldenberg  in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine  to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones  but they wisely eschew easy answers  giving equal time to both sides  and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane  in the end  there is no right or wrong  nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other  even slightly sothere are just two very viable points of view  each with their own merits  each with their own faults  the complex role of ellie is an actresss dream  and foster  a virtual shooin for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year  more than rises to the challenge  she conveys intelligence  determination  warmth  and  in a gutsy move  always on edge  we root for ellie and feel for her  but we also feel at times that she goes too far  contact is clearly fosters vehicle  but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles  matthew mcconaughey  who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role  holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie  spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss  however  his main storyline  the tentative palmerellie romance  is the films weakest subplot   john hurt is effectively creepy as s  r  hadden  the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding  angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine  most memorable of all  though  are tom skerritt and james woods  who play rival scientist dr  david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz  respectively  both  especially skerritt  embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances  zemeckis comes off of his threeyear break in top shape  always known as a director of effectsladen extravaganzas  it comes as no surprise that contacts visual effects are quite stunning  the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of   a space odyssey  but with more advanced technology at his disposal  zemeckiss voyage is even trippier than stanley kubricks yet more wondrously pure  and zemeckis doesnt resist the urge to use the alwaysinteresting incorporateactorsintoexistingfilmfootage effect  which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump  effects  however  are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama  emotion  and pure wonder  which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump  it says a lot that  in a summer science fiction film such as this  its not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised  the thoughtprovoking  twohourplus contact is a muchwelcome change of pace from summer nobrainers  but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isnt entertaining  for all the interesting questions it asks  the film is still what its being sold as  a journey to the heart of the universe   and what a fascinating  unforgettable journey it is  ,1,1
71,well i guess its that time of the year again  the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even  try  writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions  its also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies  pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  in america they call this time  summer  and it happens once every year  and maybe its the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it  but in the process normally weak  insipid lines like  consider this a divorce    hasta la vista  baby   and  youre the disease  im the cure  actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs  this is not entirely a bad thing  of course  what am i talking about  im talking about the summer  blockbusters   the  action thrillers   the  thisobviouslycostalotsoyouknow everyonesgoingtogo  explosions  gas threats  flying saucers  and special effects  in the rash of  my  what big guns you have  but wait  mine are bigger  movies  there are also the usual boymeetsfishandsavesenvironment movies  or whale  whatever   and  this  year  the odd crop of  savetheworldfromaliensorenvironment threats  offerings  im talking about the three batmans  the speeds  the terminators  etc  this year im talking about twister  independence day  the arrival  the rock  mission  impossible  and of course  eraser  here in singapore  as our local movie critics like to whine  we seem to get the pick of the crop of  my explosion is more reallooking than yours  movies  but nothing else  mission  impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us  the same goes for eraser  which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called  mission  unavoidable   on account of its worldwide megaadvertising blitz   eraser seems like a cheaper  less thoughtful imitation  thats saying a lot  because mi the movie was already a cheap  thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the ss  in eraser  arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger  he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and resituating them with new identities  his new case is lee cullen  played by vanessa williams who  unlike all the other scumbags hes ever relocated  is  an actual  real life honest person   because shes so good  and has such nice legs  arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her  and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from  his  killers  lee obtains evidence that the hightechnology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated  blackmarket arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair  of course  as the formula goes  her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck  there are people in high places who will go down with this  because yes  this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world  that is  america  since watergate  in protecting lee  arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin  nicely played by james caan  and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new  green guns his enemies all have  its around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission  impossible theme  because arnies mission includes breaking into a highsecurity building to run a disk  i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about  its an electromagnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles  and which can see through walls  it has some sort of xray vision  so its user can target the victims heart even from great distances  despite this  which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun  though im certainly no expert   however  arnold  whose own heart is targeted a number of times   never  goes flying  feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun  instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time  giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous   ill be back   like everyone else in the theater  i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me  because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily  although there is a  lot  of violence in this movie  not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators  i recommend this movie to most overs who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas  reviews rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than

73,the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation  batman and robin  both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts  but also their monosyllabic dialogue and emptyheaded character motivations  in panelsized morsels  implausible plots and  rambo  esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork  but on thirty foot silver screens  its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures  spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons  white  who is framed by a corporate baddie  played without irony by sheen   then set on fire and left for dead  though the movie skimps on the next few plot points  heres what i could determine  said assassin then becomes the leader of satans army  under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown  leguizamo  grating as always   he is renamed  for reasons unbeknownst  spawn  and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon  but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child  he realizes that he cant be the evil superdemon hes expected to be  and he sets about avenging his untimely death  typical of summer blockbusters  spawn is an effectsladen ninety minute rock video  while the visions of hell are laughably crude  think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man   spawns prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold  but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion  spawn longs for his wife  but they dont have a single scene together before simmons death    conflict  who will triumph is not anybodys guess   and believability  not that i expected it   so many questions are left unanswered  and im sure they wont be addressed in the inevitable sequel  while last years the crow  city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative  which was lazy and somewhat incoherent   it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power  spawn is an inyourface  screaming banshee of a film  these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid  but they havent the faintest idea how to make a movie  ,0,0
74,the characters in  palmetto  collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie  and its just the right way to capture the films ripe atmosphere of sensuality  tension and even farce  this humid floridaset thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself  which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke  as far as setup is concerned  the movie is nothing we havent seen before  but be patient   palmetto  spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really dont see coming  its not a classic by any means  but it sure is quite an engaging surprise  harry barber  woody harrelson  is fresh out of prison  where hes served a couple of years for a crime he didnt commit  even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials  harrys first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina  gina gershon   while searching for work  he catches the eye of rhea malroux  elisabeth shue   the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire  rhea proposes a scheme thatll get harry    easy  to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette  chloe sevigny     you do like risks  dont you  mr  barber   rhea alluringly coos  boys  form a line behind me  part of  palmetto  s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue  who demonstrates here that her oscarnominated turn in  leaving las vegas  might merely be foreshadowing great things to come  shues a seductive  campy delight  and pulls off a barbara stanwyckgloria swanson combo with admirable relish  the other actors form a solid ensemble around her  including sevigny   kids    tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease  as well as the everlikeable gershon  cast a far cry from her extreme roles in  bound  and  showgirls   harrelson is still doing fine followup work to  the people vs  larry flynt     palmetto  does have its share of grievances  harrelsons narration is needless  i suppose  and gershons nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is  one of the plots unexpected angles  that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which hes involved  could have been played a little better  there are moments when you question the tone  but its never so unstable that it deserves the reproach its been receiving from most other critics  if  palmetto  didnt want to be laughed at  would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a liveaction  who framed roger rabbit   although a few elements can be questioned  the movie works well on its own terms  thanks to a juicy cast  especially shue  and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff  you remember him from last summers suddenly repopular  the tin drum   right    everything runs smoothly  and for fans of revelationheavy endings  this films got a few shocks in store that i wont even dream of revealing    palmetto  is a generous amount of fun to watch  and thats all you need to know  ,1,1
75,lake placid is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie  ok so maybe it is  but this one is enjoyable  and clever  actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film  well the ending is kinda scary  but in most horrorcomedies they are  i will admit that lake placid isnt an oscar worthy film  but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny  bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating  is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth  after a man is bit in half  she gets there but really doesnt understand why she is there  bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened  along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man  they go out and find what is going on  what they find though isnt great  a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid  over  years old  he has migrated here for who knows why  they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from  betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid  and well youll have to see the movie to find out  her character is very funny and foulmouthed  which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad  but funny  to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws  with the opening sequence  and some others  it is not original and is  when you watch this movie  you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it  david e  kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal  writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job  the characters have smartmouths  two foul  and some great oneliners  but believe me  dont take lake placid too seriously or you wont like it  but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun popcorn type movie  but i guess it rates above the popcorn rating  sit back  watch the movie  laugh  scream  and whatever you want  even though the movie is r  and i put violence and gore  theres really not that much gore  but what there is might seem kinda gross to some  lake placid is a smart  clever  funny  and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too  ,1,1
76,so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton  but they just dont get the good grades  so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools  legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide  the remaining roommates will get an automatic     chris  michael vartan  and tim  matthew lillard  are two guys who really want the    to get into harvard  how far will they go to get their     chris and tim are also roommates with rand  played by randall batinkoff  the two scheme to murder rand  make it look like a suicide  so they can supposedly get their     they have heard this rumor many places  and they are willing to take the chance to find out  rand is a very  very mean person  he treats his girlfriend natalie  played by tamara craig thomas  like she doesnt matter at all  she is very afraid of him  and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant  she does tell him  and he becomes enraged  that night would be the last night of rands life  tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison  making him think that it is beer  rand drinks down the poison  and then dies  now  tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself  it does not take long until the suicide note is found  but the body isnt found  the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information  feeling extreme guilt  chris is having a very hard time  especially with his girlfriend  emma  played by keri russell  she wants to know more  but he will not even speak with her  will he give in  will tim turn chris in  will chris turn tim in  will they turn themselves in  all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film  the events in the curve are very surprising  original  and fun  the plot sounds much like dead man on campus  but that is not the deal with this film  this film is a very serious one  with not many laughs  there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films  the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying  it is a terrific  suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen  hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride  the sound really stood out in the film  it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film  the way the movie is filmed is also great  all of the technical aspects  as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done  the performances in the curve are very good  matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role  just like in s scream    a  he is very strange in this film as well  i like him in this sort of role  rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and shes all that  michael vartan is fantastic as chris  who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the     michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed  where he costarred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student  keri russell also gives a great performance  she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film  tamara craig thomas is also realistic  especially coping with the death of her boyfriend  some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles  such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case  the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a    note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early   it was decided the film would not be released widely  it is now available at blockbuster video only  and for rent only  see you at the video store  ,1,1
77,no  i did not read the novel by thomas hardy   jude the obscure   his final novel  final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again  see  i did do some research on it  about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life  but  after watching the movie  i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is    jude  is a satirical film from start to finish about societys way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system  but whats remarkable is how timeless this film is  the film takes place in the late th century  or early th  wasnt really sure   but its story could even be retold today in modern form  although itd be kinda different  a given   it tells the story of jude  christopher eccleston  the psychotic accountant from  shallow grave    a simple  dimwitted young man with big dreams  in its bleak  foreboding opening  shot in grainy black and white  he gets a lesson from phillotson  liam cunningham   his teacher  as they stand upon a mountain  looking upon a city in the distance  he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world  after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella  rachel griffiths  because they frolicked in the hay  literally  but did not ultimately share anything in common  he moves away to a town with a giant university  with a chance to learn more  and get ahead in life  taking a welding job  he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars  reciting latin over and over again  and training himself  but when he sends his application for the school in  he is bluntly told to just remain a worker  another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there  sue  kate winslet   his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher  she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends  so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job  for none other than phillotson at the local school   there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business  nudge nudge   several twists turn in the storyline  and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business  an interesting scene  to say the least      and are soon born into a controversial nonwedlock  as she eventually gives birth to their baby  and jude inherits his son from arabella  who turns up again after awhile  because they arent married  and because theyre cousins  they run into problems with every place they go to  carrying around two children everywhere  and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time  then moving on  if you didnt think this was harsh enough  wait till you see what happens later on    the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world  he will never gain any true happiness  and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting  and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life  part of it is his fault  hes too optimistic  and too gullible  but society has a way of taking these people  and hurting them until their death  the ending of  jude  is bleak because it has to be  although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse  guess ill have to read it now     jude  offers a satirical view on societys cruelties  but shows no way of curing this  and thank heavens it doesnt  theres no way to relinquish the selfishness of society  and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem  satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds  and thats what  jude  is  sure  its one hell of a downer  but it needs to be  the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads  and some good supporting work along with it  christopher eccleston  slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression  plays jude wonderfully  sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face  and making him kind of childlike at other times  kate winslet  in a pre  titanic  performance  is brilliant  nailing every psyche of her character  and creating someone whos troubled but very seductive with her personality  kate may be the best actress in her age group  if you dont believe me  see  titanic   branaghs  hamlet    sense and sensibility   and  heavenly creatures   the latter one being my favorite performance of hers   in the supporting roles  liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher  exposing all his bad parts  but ultimately being a pretty good person  and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as judes wife  whom he never divorces    jude  moves at a very slow pace  and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists  which would drive some people nuts  but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films  no matter how slow or downright depressing they are  this one is both  will appreciate  jude   though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it  ,1,1
78,look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future  some sort of decision had to be made  and  for better or worse  it irrevocably altered the course of your existence  from timetotime  everyone thinks about the roads not taken  and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different  perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action  catching the  am train  for example  could have an equally profound  yet less obvious  impact  maybe thats where you met your significant other  and  had you reached the platform just a few seconds later  film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else  and thats why theres no shortage of movies about this subject  the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski  who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance  these themes weave their way through many of his movies  including decalogue  the double life of veronique  and the triptych of blue  white  and red  however  they are most explicitly examined in a  film called blind chance  where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action  missing or catching a train  changes the course of his life  in his autobiography  kieslowski on kieslowski  the director describes his attraction to the concept this way   the idea is rich and interesting  that every day were faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which were completely unaware   while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films  including  in a way  frank capras its a wonderful life   sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths  the  road not taken  approach isnt just a plot device  either  writerdirector peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just missescatches a train  the audience watches  with evergrowing fascination  how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life  her future career  where she lives  whom she loves  and whether she has a family  as her separate destinies diverge and then reconverge  she becomes two completely different individuals  that woman is helen  played by gwyneth paltrow as a long  dark haired brit  one day  after losing her job as an advertising executive  she decides to return home in the middle of the day  the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform  in scenario   she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station  on board  she meets the cheerful  talkative james  john hannah   a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty  minutes later  in her flat  she walks in on her lover  gerry  john lynch   in bed with another woman  jeanne tripplehorn   in scenario   she misses the train and  shortly thereafter  is the victim of an attempted mugging  she doesnt meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerrys infidelity  juxtaposed one against the other  while sharing many places  cues  and characters  the two stories proceed in parallel from there  on one level  for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate  sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience  but  for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting  a script with a few twists  and a great deal of genuinely funny material  sliding doors still fits the bill  one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences  those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures  and those who could care less  it shouldnt come as any surprise that the acting  at least from three of the four leads  is solid  paltrow  who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same  yet gradually become much different  is the standout  she plays both of her roles effectively and believably  the shy  insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated  platinumblond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man  john hannah  known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral  is instantly likable  john lynch  taking a break from movies about irelands troubles  does a good job presenting gerry as a inept  selfish philanderer  only jeanne tripplehorn  who plays an overthetop vixen  seems out of place  her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring  and its occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element  one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice  douglas mcferran  who plays gerrys best friend  russell  is an absolute delight  stealing every scene that hes in  part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie  on one occasion  he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy  on another occasion  while laughing at gerrys plight with the women in his life  he comments   being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable   but its not all in the dialogue  mcferran tears into this part with relish  his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a topnotch comedy  this is the first feature film for peter howitt  and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb  the script is shrewd and inventive  combining wit  romance  and intelligent melodrama into a crowdpleasing whole  sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies  however  for those who are so inclined  its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe  all while having a good time  ,1,1
79,martin scorseses triumphant adaptation of edith whartons the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker  the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life  it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early s  but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder  and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker  this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorseses finest  newland archer  daylewis  is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland  ryder   a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker  who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful  the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families  in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others  on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may  countess ellen olenska  pfeiffer   cousin of may  walks into archers life  archer is immediately captivated  and finds himself in love with ellen  archer is also bound by the limits of new york society  which is an intrusive as any other in the world  archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska  attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status  the films subject matter may seem alien to scorsese  but the theme is definitely not  it is a theme of forbidden romance  guilty pleasures  and the consequences causes because of those actions  there is a painstakingly flawed hero  and his choice between the life he wants  and the life he is destined for  in truth  it is a film about a society the audience doesnt know about  but wants to find out more  much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun  the performances are absolutely breathtaking  daylewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take  pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska  a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well  ryder is probably the gem of the group  for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot  and slowly pushes daylewis closer and closer to his eventual ending  the supporting cast is also wonderful  with several characters so singular that they are indelible in ones memory  scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking  his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight  he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery  his script is also excellent  slow in buildup  with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed  it is difficult to make a period piece gripping  scorsese  however  does it beautifully  the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere  he is patient  but he films everything and anything remotely important  the cameras sweep  pan  track  and do more than theyve ever done  but they are so subtle  one doesnt realize hes watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a nd viewing  the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot  but the viewer doesnt notice it  because we want to see more of this gorgeous world  there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding  and joanne woodward narration is exquisite  not a fast film like goodfellas  this shares more in common with kundun than anything else  and like kundun  this is a slowstarting film that truly shines  when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end  a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year  ,1,1
80,when bulworth ended  i allowed myself a sigh of relief   it is possible for me to enjoy political satire   there have been several recent political films that didnt do a whole lot for me  wag the dog  for instance  i found to be an intelligent but heartless film  while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness   bulworth is a far better film than these  both in its execution and lasting impression   its a tremendously funny and intelligent picture  but it also has an emotional center  writerdirectorstar warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character  and  in turn  we like him and actually care about the story    beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth  the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again   he hasnt slept in days  nor has he eaten  and  almost instantaneously  he goes insane    hes not stark raving mad  not outright  anyway   but hes definitely bonkers    its the final weekend of his campaign  and his assistant  murphy  oliver platt  has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto    bulworth begins the speech  but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest     you mean   one lady asks   the democratic party doesnt care about the african american community      well   he shouts  laughing   isnt that obvious   the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life  he muses later that its a bad thing to make decisions when youre suicidal   he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses  graham beckel  whom he believes to be the hitman    bulworth also meets nina  halle berry  with whom he becomes infatuated    suddenly  in the short span of this weekend  bulworths nononsense  truth in politics  methods become a national sensation  and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that hes appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences  beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent   his script and direction are both extremely sharp  as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself   here is a man whos reached his limit  and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure   i like that the film doesnt take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations  but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich  although the antirich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film    some of the segments are simply hilarious  such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him   much of the film is completely absurd  but thats the fun part about it   its an angry  serious film at the core  but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre   what adds to this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth  this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale    beatty is so much fun to watch here  hes always funny  but hes also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions    beatty is so good that bulworth  despite his shortcomings as a human being  is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning  the supporting cast is vast and colorful   berry is luminous  as always  and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles   don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses guntoting toddlers to do his dirty work   oliver platt is an actor who should be careful  for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting  though hes very funny to watch    paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections  is bulworth offensive   i suppose some may see it that way   i wasnt offended by the film  but then again  i hardly care about politics   i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story   the film isnt perfect  of course  the ending didnt quite work for me  and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced  although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic    but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film   bulworth is a smart  uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface   ,1,1
81,the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber  the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse  and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest  little caper adventure entitled where the money is   the elderly bank robber is henry  paul newman   a famous criminal that was only recently caught  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune  always the shrewd thinker  he begins working on a plan to get out of jail  this involves years of studying buddhism and selfhypnosis  when he is prepared to execute his plan  he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke  now a seemingly twitching vegetable  he is temporarily transferred to a staterun home  carol  linda fiorentino  is the nurse that cares for him  shes a very bright person with a good heart  yet  her life is a miserable waste of time  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics  worse  shes in a deadend relationship with highschool sweetheart wayne  dylan mcdermott   they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom  to her  this made sense long ago  but now  its a different story  wayne seems equally bored with his life  but is content enough to stay put  waynes greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients  but shes never been anywhere else and doesnt see many other opportunities in life  however  when henry falls under her care  her outlook begins to change  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke  carol  however  begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all  maybe she can get through to him  and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away  the opening  minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry  back to life   and what are some of carols resuscitation techniques  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses  if that fails  maybe shell try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a foot high pier into the cold lake below  when he finally comes out of his state of selftrance  the movies direction changes  though it remains equally if not more entertaining  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and selfassuredness  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy  this  of course  puts wayne in an odd situation  henry and carols bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash  meanwhile  this is carols ticket to a better life  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation  but helps out nonetheless  however  his lack of commitment threatens their success  the heist sequence is suspenseful  well paced  and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong  where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist  newman is the real joy of the film  adroitly showing that at age   hes still really hot stuff  he possesses a sly smile  displays a dominating attitude  and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive  fiorentino is also a fun presence  you root for her despite her sense of amorality  sure  she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchairstricken man into a lake  but we can see that to escape her deadend world  she needs to do something drastic  with two charismatic characters such as these  its hard to ignore that where the money is is where the fun is  ,1,1
82,heres something to chew on  whats the favorite food of big  cheesylooking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard  because thats the depth of the most fully developed character in this painfully generic creature feature  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer  in fact  considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas  perhaps it was  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh  both human and nonhuman  been scattered in all directions  we learn some bloody trivia  as well  such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red  it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains  and what it does with halfdigested leftovers  i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre  but it doesnt do much for me  on the surface  and thats about the only level at which this film can be analyzed  deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic  everyone else is citing the equally valid alienstitanic connection  since james cameron directed both   in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongueincheek mayhem of tremors  deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin  the film is not humorous  tense  or exciting  in fact  its downright boring  and  despite being half the length of camerons current boxoffice champ  deep rising feels like the longer movie  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot  probably not  since its easy to guess  but ill go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics  theres finnegan  treat williams   the boats pilot  whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff  joey  kevin j  oconnor   the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny  but is really just irritating   and hanover  wes studi   the  mastermind   and i use that term lightly  of the operation  their goal  attack a cruise ship  clean out the safe  then sink it using some illegallyacquired torpedoes  the problem is  by the time they reach the argonautica  the titaniclike luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste  aside from a beautiful jewel thief  famke janssen  and a couple of crew members  theres no one on board  the reason soon becomes obvious  the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles  the cast  which is led by treat williams  is primarily comprised of hasbeens and probablyneverwillbes  two exceptions  wes studi  best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans  and djimon hounsou  amistads cinque   williams  once a  cant miss  prospect in hollywood  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising  and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  famke janssen  who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye  is the perfect bland match for williams  given her limited acting abilities  its likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes  unfortunately  a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet teeshirt for half of the picture  meanwhile  kevin j  oconnor  who has entirely too much screen time  exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard  these days  audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computergenerated special effects  this is a lesson that writerdirector stephen sommers  who previously helmed the liveaction jungle book  needs to learn  the days of jurassic park  when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen  are past  now  moviegoers are looking for the sophistication of titanic  visuals that are so wellincorporated that its impossible to tell where they end and where  reality  begins  in deep rising  the monster  like everything  is artificial and unconvincing  unfortunately  the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre  although  to be fair  deep rising is a particularly bad entry   even once this film has sunk out of sight  the knowledgeable viewer knows it wont be the last of its kind  like the slimy  slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies  more are waiting just around the corner in ambush  and that consideration  unlike anything on screen  is truly horrifying  ,0,0
83,okay  i just dont know why  but i seem to be getting this diversion to disneymade reallife actors movies    as well as reallife acting tim allen movies  i couldnt even make it through  the santa clause   so why did i even see this    just to make an idle point  i did like  toy story   but that was good  also  i have this aversion to bad french farces  and if they remake them into american films  well  this is my excuse  it was prom night  im not a prom person  my best friend and i impulsively went to the driveins where they were playing  grosse pointe blank   wouldnt mind seeing it again  but i had to suffer through this first  i agreed to go  ugh  in all fairness  i can say that at least this inane plot wasnt dreamed by an american  it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of  little indian  big city   french title   un indien dans la ville    i stayed away from it like it was limburgher  and according to roger ebert  that was a good idea  but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement  the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage  let me clarify  his wife  jobeth williams  left him years ago  and i mean years  around  or so  and went to an island in the carribean or something  he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this    thing   played with an emphasis on overdone by lolita davidovitch  who is usually good   she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off  he meets him  he has a weird name  mimi seku  i think    or as the bad joke goes   mitsubishi   laugh track cue   he knows english  they fish  more bad jokes  pirhanna joke  the kid has a pet spider  he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty    you know the drill  now this is where the plot complicates  well  complicates for this one  at least   the fishoutofwater joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city  tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasnt able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is  martin short  a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere  how come in every hokey french import  there is a mob    tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries  the story is crap  the jokes are hokey and not really funny  and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting  but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it  the whole time  i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this  at the end of filming  did they all scream out   weve made a great movie  guys   i sure hope not  big question to get from this film  why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if theyre just going to do it the exact same way  huh  my  for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle  i guess    okay  so i really feel bad for it  so i only gave it one star  ,0,0
84,a followup to disneys liveaction   dalmatians  thats better  more entertaining than the first  just as unlikely  with   dalmatians   the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs  more is definitely  not  the merrier  s   dalmatians  certainly wasnt the greatest moviegoing experience of all time  but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous  largerthanlife performance  in addition  we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson  and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies  this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen  and closes facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the yearold actress under that startling black and white wig of hers  but thats only half the problem with kevin limas laborious film  what makes   dalmatians  such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor  here almost singlehandedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks hes a dog  voiced by eric idle   its rabid plotlessness  cruella goes after puppies again  winds up in goo again  and most of all  the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic  heroes  of the piece  a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blanderthanbland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo   gruffudd is cute and harmless  perhaps  but evans cant even aspire to that  the dogs upstage them both  of course  but in the case of evans  even closes split ends are more animated  bad acting  however  seems to be a requirement for this sequel  since g  rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niros in  men of honor   jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieus overthetop antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail  and wail for wail  frances most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself  and in   dalmatians  the producers milk that realization for all its worthle pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as  poopies   par example  and ad nauseum   the finesses of the script  attributed to four screenwriters no less  and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up  are quickly dispensed with  since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben     that done  its back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore offlimits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown  the dogs are pretty cutetry making a puppy look otherwisebut thats pretty much all they are  theres always the feeling that theres a trainer off in the wings  coaxing the dogs to open doors  or pick up their food bowls in unison  or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder  savvy holiday goers should skip   dalmatians  and pop the original  animated classic into  their  vcrs instead  its one dalmatian less  but  more satisfying  ,0,0
85,the latest epos from lars is a blast  although a rather moody one  this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the  something  the church  calvinistic  is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower  they are considered being too unrestrained  in these surroundings we find the tobeweds jan and bess  played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson  jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess   is just bess  a bit naive and innocent  in every aspect of the word   at first  at the wedding party we are told an anecdote  illustrating her infinite kindness  she once lend a bike to an stranger  her best friends bike however  but bess is suffering in this scary religious society  we soon take part in a funeral where a man  fallen off the orthodox path  is laid to rest while doomed to hell  women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church  when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend  almost manic  that her friends try to calm her down a bit  the time has come when jan is to return to the rig  bess is falling into the darkness of depression  her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves  she cant stand the thought of life without her husband  we witness her dialogues with god  she speaks both parts  paranoia   convincing god to return jan from the oilrig  and her prayers are heard  an accident on the rig bring him back  paralysed from the neck and down  now he cant satisfy her need for physical love  he try to persuade her into finding a lover  with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail  at first she resist  but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply  imagine what this is doing to the poor girl  the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby  accompanied by music from the era  procol harum  deep purple  trex and others  the use of handheld camera and lack of any makeup make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre  the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant  though a bit too gloomy for my taste  i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue     le matin  and bitter moon  lunes de fiel   emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances  this must be the reason for giving it the  grand prix du jury  in cannes this year  although we had hoped for the  palme dor    the screenplay is now available in print  the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july  just in time for the danish premiere  ,1,1

88,i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films  when done right  with at least slightly evident restraint  they can be engaging  sweeping  appealing  but its a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle  a hollow  boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers  the ones willing to buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance  tom hanks and meg ryan  two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed  repectively  baldwins wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son  jonah  seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse  jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems  sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show  but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out  ephron has him do this so that annie reed  meg ryan  can hear it  annie is a happy woman  she is engaged to walter  an allergyprone working man and seems to be perfectly content  but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show  she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it  five years after this movie hit theaters  hanks  ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better  although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail  which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet  at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity  here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five  the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory  sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers  from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell  but none of them can save the film from being a bore  its characters are dull and empty  its script isnt funny or particularly charming  the script has a fundamental problem  annie gives up  for little reason  her life with walter to pursue  sleepless in seattle   whom she has never even seen  its the kind of life decision that real people dont make  and its a major  unforgivable plausibility sacrifice  in essence  this movies purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldnt even exist  its a ten minute short film with ninetyfive minutes of filler  if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didnt have to review it  you could just call me  asleep in philadelphia      eugene novikov  ,0,0
89,theres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy  return of the jedi  the final installment of the series  is easily the most innovative  actionpacked  and entertaining of the three films  the dark  eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone  instead  for return of the jedi  we have good triumphing decisively over evil  a resolution to a love triangle  and walking teddy bears  even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around  with the arrival of the emperor  an apparitionlike creature played by ian mcdiarmid   vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back  luke skywalker  mark hamill   princess leia  carrie fisher   lando calrissian   billy dee williams   chewbacca  peter mayhew   cp  anthony daniels  and rd  kenny baker  are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine  their goal  to save han solo  harrison ford  from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt  it is at jabbas home  a creepylooking stone fortress guarded by hognosed beasts  that most of the added special effects come into play  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge  the effects are top notch  as soon as han is freed from his cryofreeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt  its back to outer space  where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat  a second  more powerful death star  that  if activated  could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor  so  while the fleet prepares for the final battle  luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks  there  they are befriended by the ewoks  the teddy bearlike native race  and luke  fearing that his presence is endangering the group  turns himself over to vader  return of the jedi has some interesting elements  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and wellacted  from a technical pointofview  the space battles are amazing  easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films  not only are there many  many more ships  but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved  on one level  return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects  in the special edition  even more ships are added  making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films  by now  or then     mark hamill  harrison ford  and carrie fisher have all matured in their onscreen personas  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific  as in empire  billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy  cunning  and evil creature  although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen  return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment  with the spectacular  new special effects  the adorable ewoks  the sinister jabba the hutt  the evil emperor  the same old millenium falcon  darth vaders incredible betrayal  the destruction of the new death star  and the always lovable yoda  return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang  congratulations to george lucas  whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come    ,1,1
90,synopsis  an aging master art thief  his supplier  and a young  buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be  or are they   in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium  comments  this movie was boring  plain and simple  entrapment should not have been boring  it stars sean connery  who can still carry an action film despite his age  catherine zetajones  a likeable enough film presence  and ving rhames  ultracool star of pulp fiction and mission  impossible  it takes full advantage of the yk computer bug fears  a current  hot topic  in the news  in its storyline  which is set at the end of   it has some genuinely wellstaged action sequences  so  what went wrong  plenty  unfortunately  the major problem with entrapment is its script  it has a beenthere  donethat feel to it  nothing seems particularly inventive or original  so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags  it runs nearly two hours   the screenwriters  for example  periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes  i  e     days to the millennium    this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked scifi film strange days  the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning  which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth  surprise  revelation is made  entrapment  in other words  relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each characters true motive is  resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion  the star power here is quite strong  but the viewer cant help but feel the actors are wasted in this production  sean connery is given such mindnumbing lines as  never trust a naked woman   ving rhames character seems like an afterthought  hes not developed at all  the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zetajoness tight wardrobe  this  in and of itself  is not bad  but  after a while  it has a juvenile feel to it  at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that theyre exploiting the female body  entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development  sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her  in tights  arc and pivot around laser beams   the tagline for this movie reads  the trap is set   it sure is  on those who spent money to see this movie  entrapment really isnt that bad  it is watchable  i would suggest  however  one waits until this is on cable or television to see it  ,0,0
91,there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space  its just that none of them happen to be actors  the stars im referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movies  outer space   the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home  yes  in terms of acting  the star power is      well  more like a falling star  kinda pretty  shortlived  and pretty much dead  lost in space  as if you really didnt know  is based on the s scifi television series of the same name  its the year   and earths precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population  john robinson  william hurt  is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet  earths entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission  but nobody  whether it be johns family or hired battle pilot don west  matt leblanc   seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years  johns family consists of his wife maureen  mimi rogers   his atypical teenage daughter penny  lacey chabert   his ingenious son will  jack johnson   and his beautiful scientist daughter judy  heather graham   despite everyones reluctance  the jupiter  spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space  unknown to anyone but the audience  there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission  dr  smith  gary oldman  has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour  and dr  smith has reprogrammed a talking robot to  destroy robinson family   when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides  the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination  and now the premise of being lost in space is complete  as for the audience  you will likely be lost in boredom by this point  wondering if the plot  like the jupiter   will ever get off the ground  its hard to tell who deserves the most blame  the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script  chabert is basically the only one to overdo it  sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium  if you  like me  were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens  youre wrong  thats just her normal voice  in yet another example of a  friend  faltering on the big screen  leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming  make sense    it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod  graham is a babe  thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film  hurt  the black hole of excitement  sucks up any energy that might have been left  if hurt were available in tablet form  he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill  johnson isnt dull  hes just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybodys ass all the time  want an example of how cool this kid can be  how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family  hey  dont laugh  the thing actually listened to the mr  rogerswouldbeproud sentiment  but alas  if you thought a character couldnt be much worse  there was rogers as the epitome of generic  or  mother as she was known   why hire an actress  they couldve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it  now that wouldve had some pizzazz  lost in space luckily doesnt suffer in every single category that it could have  the special effects are crisp  clear  and at least mildly captivating  unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman  who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse  unfortunately  oldman is locked away for most of the film  giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy  while the special effects are pleasing to the eye  they are nothing you couldnt find in most modern scifi films  contact  for example  far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination  lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art  with numerous contradictions  the time travel aspect was horribly flawed    wooden and corny acting  worse dialogue  and an ending so disappointing  youd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens  then again  with an ending like this film has  its obvious a sequel is already being considered  what an awful note to end on  knowing there could be more of this in a year or two  the attempt to be family oriented is commendable  but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups  well  danger potential movie goers  danger  this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity  ,0,0
92,well  as i check my score card for what ive done this holiday weekend  it reads good ideas   and dumb ideas    i dont know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie  but in my defense  i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him  the film that im talking about is a night at the roxbury   one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit  wayne and garth  these two are not  rather  we meet doug and steve butabi  the actors names are not worth mentioning   two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city  the roxbury  driving in their dads bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice  they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club  have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt   they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change  their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pickup lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl  let me see that label  just as i thought  made in heaven   says one of the brothers   and  like the losers that they are  they fail to do either for much of the film  however  as fate would have it  an accidental meeting with whateverhappenedto richard grieco gives them the allimportant ticket to get in  their sad lives take on a whole new direction  they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene  and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women  but their newfound popularity does not impress their father  who has other plans for them  the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a onejoke movie  and the brothers are the joke  actually  theres about  mintues worth of tolerable stuff  alas  too long for tv and way too short for a featurelength film  thus  there just isnt enough material to sustain the minute movie  theres no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaways europop song  what is love  i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash  to take up more film time  there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug  this creates not only friction between the brothers  but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well  shes educated and a forebearing witch  meanwhile  doug is a complete loser  how did these two ever get together  i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question  ill have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie  if youre looking for entertainment  you wont find it at the roxbury  ,0,0
93,bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan  to pull something like this off  you need to have a sense of wit and style  with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines  something like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements  and in return  the film was tremendous fun  with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player  bats mainly plays its premise for straightarrow horror  judging by the ridiculous premise  this was not exactly a wise move  the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds  but fails miserably  done right  it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema  unfortunately  bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly  terribly wrong  the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be  i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom bats is aimed toward  those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats  these bats are not very nice  because they eat a lot of people  boy  are these bats ugly  they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart  theyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  a whole bunch of people in texas get killed  so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats  they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with  but the bats are pretty smart  so its sorta hard to do  the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good  but no  bats is probably too violent for preschoolers  the film  directed by louis morneau  should have ventured straight into video stores  on the small screen  perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations  but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward  although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure  the film is poorly written  poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude  even the bats themselves are cheesy  and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed  the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey  lou diamond phillips   who embodies every pathetic stereotype a smalltown authority figure usually portrays  he chomps on a cigar  struts contentedly in his boots  etc      the scientist is dr  sheila casper  dina meyer   who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field  meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable  but everything about dr  casper is recycled beyond recognition  her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws  everything revolving around bats is tired drivel  which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up  the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw  with voices dubbed in later  in fact  that may have worked out better in the end  take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy  leon   and youll have immediate deja vu  hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie  constructed specifically for timed comic relief  unfortunately  none of his comic interludes are funny  in the role of deranged mad scientist dr  mccabe  the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch  mccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects  and the virus spread to other bats  the entire town of gallup  texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures  but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else  something like  when is the damn movie going to be over   i just want my money   the bats are ugly  i must say  theres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing  but mainly  the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery  only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been  but by the absurdly stupid climax  its way too late in the game for a decent recovery  characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire  lets explore the logic there  is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population   you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one  and after that there are only    more of them  this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats  ,0,0
94,deep rising is one of  those  movies  the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us  it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god    screw that  it says boldly  lets see some computer generated monsters rip into  decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors  heh  them wacky monsters  gotta love em  of course  since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story  hollywood must give that little extra  oumph  to get people in theaters  that is where deep rising fails  which is a good thing  confused  let me explain  despite all them flashy effects and big explosions  deep rising is still  at heart  a good ol b movie  luckily  its a very good b movie  the worst cliches in movie history are a b movies bread and butter  therefore  things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre  of course we know theres a big slimy creature behind that door  that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive  we just dont know when or how horrible it will be  i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high  imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually  well  pretty darn funny at times  a funny b movie  well  thats new  these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh    except for a few unintended laughs once a while   and before you know it  treat williams  wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen  hey  i know them guys  and gal  from a couple of other movies  cool  familiar faces  so far so good  our man treat is the hero  hell live  wes is a staple of b movies  he is the token victim  we know hell buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out  famke is the babe  nuff said  there is also a guy with glasses  the guy with glasses always dies  a black person  b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies  never fails  and a very funny  nerdy guy    ah  comic relief  how can we possibly explain having to kill him    let him live   after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home  i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew    please kill me   suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times  went  ewwww  about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing  im a man  we nottice these things  all in all  id recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door    but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you  the acting is decent  the effects top rate  how to best describe it  put together the jet ski scene from hard rain  the bug attacks from starship troopers  a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming  dont go there  hes behind you  and you end up with deep rising  for creepy crawly goodness  tight tshirts  major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water  ,1,0
95,conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that childrens items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twentyfive or thirty years after the item was made  thats when the kids of that time have jobs  disposable income and a desire to revisit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives  check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and youll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks  theres a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the workaday world for a long time  theyd like to recapture some of that fun they remember from days of yore  hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time  and for the most part theyre messing it up    mission impossible    lost in space    godzilla    zorro   none of these successfully capture the originals  none of these are even good films  you can now add  the avengers  to the list  the british television series began in   super secret agent john steed  thenpatrick macnee  and his third partner  emma peel  thendiana rigg  are the pair that the american audience fell for  surrealistic and witty  the series fit the mood of the times  the leatherclad rigg probably didnt hurt the ratings either  after all its not a coincidence that you cant pronounce her characters name without  appeal   now were in the nineties  steed  nowralph fiennes  and peel  nowuma thurman  are battling evil genius sir august de wynter  sean connery  who is screwing with englands weather  thats about as much of a plot as we have  theres some footage about a lot of other things that either dont make sense or make even less sense  we get betrayal for some unknown reason  evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film  remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason  theres a high tech hot air balloon  but i have no idea why anyones in it  the spy agency is run by a man called  mother  who is in a wheelchair and a woman named  father  who is blind    at least in some scenes  theres probably a reason for all of this  but well never know it  macnee makes an appearance of sorts  he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  a group of villains sits around a table  all clad in huge pastelcolored teddy bear outfits  at first its humorous to watch the teddies waddle around  but then it becomes goofy  the movie is a medley of clutter  confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  it feels like major portions of the film are missing  the storyline jumps rather than flows  reportedly the film was recut several times  this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing  theres one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher  other than that  the effects are secondrate  the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes  thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesnt work  she looks good  dresses in all the right fetish outfits but theres no spark  fiennes fares even less well  macnees steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor  fiennes agent comes across as a dour kid in grownup clothes who has never been out of his home town  even connery  one of the greatest living actors  doesnt have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes  the action scenes are difficult to follow  director jeremiah chechik  responsible for the atrocious remake of  diabolique   somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldnt be  things happen  people move around  but even if  with the utmost effort  you were able to care about any of it  the scenes are bewildering  the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads  witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination  admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film  but theres no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever  one of emma peels first lines of dialog is  rules are made to be broken   it doesnt get any better  advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone  the release date was changed several times  connery refuses to promote the film  there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers  at least this way  they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out  admittedly i havent seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades  my guess is that it would be severely dated now  no matter how antiquated it might be  theres no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing  theres no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie  no reason at all  ,0,0

97,warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest  craziest and hard hitting movie in his career  based on a story concocted by himself  and also written by beatty  bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system  beatty stars as senator jay bulworth  whos going through a nervous breakdown  after hiring someone to kill him  he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about whats really happening in american politics  much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy  platt   instead of everyone hating him  the american public love him  however  inside his party  more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin  and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina  berry   its remarkable that this film was released at all  much more open than the rather subdued primary colours  bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name  the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny  and also somewhat true  its great that beatty isnt afraid to let loose on a subject  talking of beatty  hes excellent in the role of the demented senator  clearing having fun  and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed  even in dick tracy  he was the most straighten face actor    then again  he was the only characters face we could completely see   the film gives an opportunity for the  year old beatty to indulge in some rapping  which he does with gusto  and also quite well   and seeing beatty as a homeboy has to be seen to be believed  its nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself  second best is oliver platt as the flustered  coke snorting assistant  who goes over the top when he finally snaps  halle berry is fine  and sexy  as the intellectual nina  who comes to like the senator  also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent  laurie metcalf as the exact same characters shes also played  and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife  who all contribute to the fun  and  this being a political film  the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance  as   shock   himself  the writing and directing  both by beatty  are above par  the direction is very nearly sitcom like  but suits the film perfectly  and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well  the script is funny  and the raps are actually well produced and humorous  and quite clever  theyre not cringe inducing  at least  the script makes many points about society in america today  and isnt afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system  best of all  the film is thought provoking  but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather  and is very entertaining  theres also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes  bulworth is a film with many advantages  and few flaws  perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a  year old man rapping  but beatty does it so well its irrelevant  in fact  theres very little against bulworth  except for the language which is very heavy  but then again it should be expected  bulworth  then  is well worth watching  a david wilcock review     you know  for kids   norville barnes ,1,1
98,taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking  go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers  the story centres around a group of people  who include brit simon  askew   and checkout girls claire  holmes  and ronna  polley  and the misadventures that they get into  split into three chapters  everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers  although qts touch is evident in nearly every frame  go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride  liman  who also photographed the film  has a deft touch with the camera  and the film looks good  the film also seems to have benefited from a budget  with the nightclub scenes in particular looking pretty good  theres a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk  the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life  holmes  one of the dawsons creek cast  a show im not particularly fond of  displays much talent here  and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature  askew is slightly successful  being rather obnoxious  no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him  but instead of funny annoying hes just annoying  he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters  but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it  the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl  her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining  also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer  who gives an nice evil performance  the script  written john august  is sharp and witty  with good dialogue and some funny jokes  it starts off rather slow however  but in about twenty minutes the script has found its footing and just keeps getting better  the stories are largely satisfying  although occasionally theres too much attention on one detail but not on another  also  some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky  still  the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it  it could of tried a little harder in some parts however  and these parts lag  because this is a genxer movie  the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany  and gos one is pretty decent  unlike other genxers movies  go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue  which is a plus  go is a very easy movie to absorb into  and the audience really starts feeling for these characters  thankfully  they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics  like the heroine in  things i hate about you   they are who they are and they stay that way  go is great fun  and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers  ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things  and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride  erm  go to go  i guess  ,1,1
99,carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town  she goes to college in california  there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore  who is a city boy  when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving  she brings shore with her  and her parents  lane smith and cindy pickett  are less than thrilled  dan gauthier  guginos boyfriend from high school  proposes to gugino  gugino isnt ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore  she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end  forget jurassic park  cliffhanger  the firm and last action hero  soninlaw is the film to see this summer  soninlaw is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers  especially fans of the wiez  when soninlaw is long gone and forgotten  the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then  this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it  nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen  although the basic story line has been done many  many times before  the film is still fun to watch  the laughs are plentiful  especially when the wiez is around  the way some of the jokes are done are new  even though some of the jokes are old  there are also several new jokes that  at least  i havent seen before  still  when presented right  even old material can be funny still  this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesnt contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price  the cast for this film does an excellent job  pauly shore  encino man  is the star attraction of this film  he is great  and knows how to entertain the audience  pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious  this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role  carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl  she makes her character believable  on some levels  yet interesting at the same time  the person who played the grandfather  mason adams  i believe  also does a great job  the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen  patrick renna  who played guginos little brother  was a little annoying  but no where as near as macaulay culkin  and for only part of the time  so i can forgive him  tiffaniamber thiessen  a killer among friends   saved by the bell   does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen  she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television  she wasnt given overly much to do in the film  but what she had  she does a good job with  ,1,1
100,in tim burtons sleepy hollow  there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name  he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe  burtons update on washington irvings classic tale of the legend of sleepy hollow offers us the mystery of the horseman  when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror  writer andrew kevin walker  seven  throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes  but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing  as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine  as sleepy hollow opens  were greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau  who won an oscar in burtons ed wood  landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow  who  on a fateful carriage ride through the forest  is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider  after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town  constable ichabod crane  johnny depp  is sent in to investigate  landlord baltus von tassel  michael gambon  explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case  and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper  played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken  who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods  crane is not a man of great superstition  and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets  things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie   first and foremost  sleepy hollow is a fun horror film  as with virtually all burton movies  we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman  who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly  the horseman fx are stylish and impressive  particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors  but why did i enjoy sleepy hollow as much as i did  although enjoyable  it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right   it was the light comic touch that burton applied  the film has the sweetness of a candy apple  usually channeled through depps wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane  who is no longer a mildmannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities  this is certainly not the only alteration thats been made  as the film progresses  it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves  the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together  because for the audience  its not an issue we particularly wish to be solved  its more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive  still  we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burtons keen eye to capture our attention  the costuming is exceptional  and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout  its recognizable that the script was refined by awardwinning playwright tom stoppard   the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many  a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassels daughter katrina  and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent  walken  michael gough  who appeared in burtons batman films  and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles  i suppose the strengths behind sleepy hollow lie within the central trio  director burton  constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy  all of this is not to be taken seriously  of course  sleepy hollow is a lavish  frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children  if youve got a decent head on your shoulders  youll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time  ,1,1
101,there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video  no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure  the culture  and the brotherhood of white supremacy  nice guy ed norton jr   who sang in everyone says i love you  plays derek  a twentyyear old skinhead  dads subtle racism grew large in derek  after gang members killed his father  dad was fighting a fire when they shot him  now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart  derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence  at a basketball court  black and white tempers flare  derek channels the aggression into a game  black versus white  for ownership of the courts  when the choice presents itself  derek goes for game point instead of the suckerpunch  cameron  stacy keach  steps in to dereks life as a surrogate father  he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings  keeping his own criminal record spotless  he uses derek as a leader and organizer for highvisibility racial intimidation  derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in racemotivated mob crimes  at the bottom of the chain  dereks younger brother danny  edward furlong  made famous in terminator   joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons  but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong  one night three black youths break into dereks truck  which is exactly what derek has been waiting for  outside in his shorts and his tattoo  he shoots them all  the third wouldbe thief  unarmed  is only wounded  in the key scene of the film  derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious  enraptured  awful stomp    the funspoiling nc of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate  considering american history x was rated r  what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal  ecstatic violence   the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief  derek does not resist the cops  and as they spin him around to cuff him  the film slows down  derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling  sadistic  satisfied grin  now in prison  derek faces new challenges  as the black man in the laundry tells him   in the joint  you the nigra  not me   there is a clique of swastikawearing skinheads  but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy  they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation  derek finds himself truly alone  truly in danger  and truly afraid  when derek finally gets out of prison  he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed  without dereks leadership  they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture  it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly hes screwed up  in the end  he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny  the film ends a little too deliberately  too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film  but it barely detracts from the overall experience  edward norton gives an oscarworthy performance  although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction  nortons performance compensated    an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store   he also captured the essence of an older brother  he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously  very lovingly  both before and after his change of heart  though clearly not for all tastes  this film is bold and daring  the subject matter is ugly  cruel  and at times hard to look at  nevertheless its subjects are part of humanitys great face  kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating  if distasteful  american subculture  ,1,1
102,i was anxious to see this for a long time  a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell  and he wanted to prove that shes as hot as he thinks he is  he proved it for me all right  but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that  scream treads on familar ground  horror movie with  as star neve campbell puts it   some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cant act whos always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door   its very familar  your typical horror film  so why  you may ask after watching it  does it seem so new and original  because it treats itself as if it hasnt been done before  and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old  familar tired stuff  this raises another question  how does it do this  simple  the characters  theyre not your typical stupid horror film victims who dont know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette  they are horror fans  they know how stuff happens in a horror movie  they know what to do and what not to do  and that makes it scary  and even funny at certain times  you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker  drew barrymore  is making popcorn  getting ready to watch a video  and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that  if she gets it wrong  will get her and her boyfriend killed  she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions  she just cant answer his final question   what door am i at   and that gets her killed  that scene works because in a normal horror film  half the things that happen in that scene would never happen  the plot is typical horror stuff  sidney prescott  an impressive neve campbell   an attractive young high school student whos mother was killed a year ago tommorrow  is being stalked by a killer whos previously murdered one of her classmates  casey  naturally   and everybody in this small  california town is a suspect  including sidneys boyfriend  billy loomis  but as i said before  these people know how horror movies work  and thats what makes it so appealing  that and the references to horror movies  like when casey says   the first  nightmare on elm street  was scary  but the rest sucked   which is obviously director wes craven  who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend  patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others  and when tatum  sidneys friend  mentions the director  wes carpenter  which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven  but also director john carpenter  the cast is well chosen  neve campbell pulls off a good heroine  and unlike most horror film heroines  she  can  act   drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film  and david arquette is impressive  also good  and funny  in his role is henry winkler   the fonz   as the school principal  i took half a point off for the unnecessary  albeit limited  appearance by friends courteney cox as reporter  gail edwards  sidneys rival because she covered her mothers disappearance  i hate that show  i hate those actors  theyre untalented  overexposed  and overpaid  imho  and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough  but i suppose he isnt  ,1,0

104,along his carreer  mel gibson has collected several successes  not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view  for all that  i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart  the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace  a popular scotch hero of the th century  where he would also perform the principal role  accepting so huge challenge  mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years  with a suppoosed failure  just to see recognized  by everyone  all his potentialities and  that way  to consolidate his position in hollywood  it was  definitely  an enormous risk but im sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face  braveheart is  in fact  a magnificent and magisterial film  for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narratives rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest  the william wallaces story is the story of so many others brave libertys defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value  along the centuries  seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression  william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i  king of england  in a war by the autonomy of scotland  as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up  his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone  including the princess isabelle of wales  wife of edwards son  however  william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought  braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty  nowadays  mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast  patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i  the king longshank  the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good  sophie marceau  as princess isabelle  has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart  i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen  as robert the bruce  and  of course  mel gibson  as william wallace  however  i think this time the mel gibsons work as director was much better than his work as actor  the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is  when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes  view by the camera of john toll  then we realize all the beauty of this film  braveheart is  in my opinion  one of the best movies of   ive heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean  for now  lets see if braveheart equalizes the  oscars of lawrence of arabia  it wont be easy  its gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson  ,1,1

106,ill be the first to admit it  when you mention the book great expectations  i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class  where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch  yes  its a classic of literature  but it was a rather dry one  shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine  certainly  the experience wasnt truly that bad  but  to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book   im not going to tell the story the way it happened    ill gonna tell it the way i remember it   anyway  to return from nostalgia lane  and get back to the present  hollywood  in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics  now presents an updated film version of great expectations  instead of pip  this time the central character is named finn  played as a boy by jeremy kissner  and by ethan hawke as an adult   finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie  or should that be mrs  joe   kim dickens   and her boorish fisherman husband  joe  chris cooper   the setting is the florida coast during the mids  finn is a blooming artist  and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish  one of his two favorite subjects   during one of these escapades  he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal  robert deniro   borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady  deniros criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity  and favors hiding on the ocean floor  ok    maybe thats an exaggeration  but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film  and thats nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat  but i digress  anyway  finn does the convict a good deed  just to show that hes a really swell guy  and then the plot moves on  enter miss havisham    or ms  dinsmoor here  anne bancroft   abandoned at the altar some  years ago  ms  dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid  with bizarre clothing  eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup  anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role  although she ends up nowhere near a believable character  she does add some humor to the film  joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner  but the insane ms  dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece  estella  raquel beaudene as a young girl  gwyneth paltrow as an adult   for no apparent reason  other than to provide the main plot of the film  finn is instantly stricken for the estella  perhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person  or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  in any case  neither as children nor adults  chemistry simply doesnt exist between the two  and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her  even when  as an adult  finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor  reacquaints himself with estella  and draws her portrait in the nude  theres nothing  in fact  there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets  at this point  the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character  and couldnt care less about the two characters  the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow  she fails to imbue estella  a remote character in the book  with even the vaguest traces of humanity  theres obviously something wrong when  watching the film  youre more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character  without a strong estella  finns obsession seems baseless  you wish he would just stop whining  let estella marry his rival  walter plane  an oddly subdued hank azaria   and just get on with his life  in fact  the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot  finns relationship with his brotherinlaw  joe  is interesting  if a bit stereotypical  whats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro  although its only a bit part  it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create  it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film  some of the shots work  but others are too obviously staged  for example  both of the water fountain scenes  to have any impact  finns art  actually the creations of italian painter  francesco clemente  is used throughout the film  but it mostly fails to have the intended effect  we never see why finn would generate this style of art  which is simultaneously crude and insightful  as a result  it ends up as distant as the rest of the film  modernizing the classics is currently in vogue  just see william shakespeares romeojuliet   simply update the action to a modern setting  and apply plenty of modern rock  but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations  as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it  youd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film  ,0,0

108,it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mstk  tm  he had never seen any episodes of the show  and i have watched a scant few  due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes  for those of you not familiar with the premise  dr clayton forrester  beaulieu  wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public  to achieve this  he  in the words of the tv series theme  which is missing in the movie   bumped mike nelson  nelson   on the noggin and then shot him into space   and is monitoring nelsons reactions to the movies he is forced to endure  rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies  nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions  tom servo and crow t  robot  the format of the show consists of nelson  servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched  and breaks every  minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love  the ship on which our heroes are marooned  only two things are different in the movie  the absence of forresters sidekick  tvs frank  and the slower pace of the jokes  this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke  for their big screen outing  the producers have chosen  this island earth   a  classic  and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill  unfortunately for that film  but making it ideal mstk fodder   acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which  by todays standards  are less than impressive  nelson  co  make jokes about everything from japans dominance in the world market  to star trek  to the state of disrepair of seattles kingdome  and most of them work  unfortunately  the segments set outside the satellites movie theater seem out of place and arent particularly funny  but at least theyre fairly short  the big question about this movie though is  why  i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series  rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago   but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen  there are no special effects to dazzle you  no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat  and no use of digital surround sound  so  it seems pointless to spend  per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for   and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts  nevertheless  mstk  tm provides more laughoutloud opportunities than any film youre going to see this year  and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse  given its uniqueness  i hesitate to grade it against other films  but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of  unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad bmovies  it does well  ,1,0

111,the most interesting part of  cant hardly wait  just happens to be not only the most human  but for many of us  the one part that many of us can easily relate to  that is the character of denise  lauren ambrose   the films sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film  and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored  the film wisely holds over this moment  nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party    almost too nicely  for some members of the audience  read  me   this is basically a mirror of whats going on with them watching this film  we sit there wondering why weve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place  i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this  after all  this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with  everyones here  the jock  the homecoming queen  the nerd  and his dominions of trekkies and xphiles   the alienated wannabe writer  the school spirit girl  the pothead  s   the wigger  etc  etc  etc  and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial  lame  and basically as a bunch of losers  except for denise  who rolls her eyes at everything  and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks  her yearbook entry  something which is done for each main character  quotes oscar wilde  definite pointers there   unfortunately  the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film  the film  as i said  portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything  however  instead of sticking with this  perhaps even going a bit further with it  they let this lie  and actually make these characters into our heroes  we follow several of them  all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism  and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared andor identified with them  and if we did  we certainly dont want to revisit that state of being  heres a quick lowdown  its graduation  and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night  otherwise known as the  american grafitti  or  to a lesser extent  the  dazed and confused  cliche  the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly  the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party    cant hardly wait  just opts for a big indoor keg party  and a little bit of aimless driving  albeit of the imwhiningbecauseicantgetagirliwant brand  we follow many people around  but mostly we trail preston  ethan embry  of  that thing you do     the alienated writer  whos been pining over the homcoming queen  amanda  the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt   for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart  now that shes broken up with her football player boyfriend  mike  peter facinelli   he decides to go to the party with a note hes written declaring his  love  for her in the hopes hell build up the guts to give it to her    even though hes leaving for a multiweek intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut  okay  the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson    since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldnt be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film  and because its a party  there are some more main characters  such as  william  charlie korsmo  finally surfacing after  dick tracy    the nerd  and his dominions  who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike  whos humiliated him for years  but gets too caught up in drinking to do it  kenny  seth green   the wigger  who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid  uh huh   and denise  the only exceptional character  who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom  dont ask  with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile  ugh  the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not  american grafitti  or  dazed and confused   two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers  not to mention were extremely entertaining   but to john hughes films of the s  most notably  sixteen candles   the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters  and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion  this film forgets to satirize its characters  and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes    and then says that its all okay  we cant take this film seriously  nor can we take this as fun  so really what good is it  but i will tell you some things i did like  i liked the direction  except for a couple toooverthetop features  like waytooglossy jump cuts  its like an oxymoron  and other obscurities  generally  though  elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement  and even manage to capture an altmanesque feel to their film from time to time  a thing with a note  though  is too hokey to really be admirable   i actually did like seth green  for once in about a decade  when he played a very young woody allen in  radio days    his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable    almost  and  of course  lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise  the one character we could have used some more of  even though it would have changed the entirety of the film  however  the character of denise really doesnt work with the film  when really thought about  shes far too witty and realized  at least for the first half  to belong in this film  and whenever she appears  she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone  shes not just the cynic or the intellectual  shes just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters  she may ruin the film more  but at least when shes on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves  well  at least well be entertained   a couple other things that just dont work  mikes character  who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything  too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general  the aimless  bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda  give me a break  and perhaps the one thing that just doesnt work at all  jenna eflmans uncredited cameo as an angel  just didnt work  but nice try  basically the worst thing about this film  the real reason im giving this such a low rating  is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything wed do  we dont feel for these characters because for most of us  we arent stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots  the acid test for high school movies is  does it at all capture the feel of what its portraying  the answer for this film is no  nice try  though  ,0,0
112,the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made  i know that is very sweeping statement  so ill qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of  science fiction   stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot    a space odyssey is probably a better film  but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science  most all other films we normally classify as science fiction  or sf  are really just fantasy  action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting  the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a hightech  for   van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town  something bad happens to them  pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight  apparently everyone in the town is dead  the authorities call a  wildfire alert   summoning four scientists  all but one of them somewhat reluctant  to a supersecret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada  two of scientists  stone and hall  fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks  their blood turned to powder in their veins  some went insane before they died and two of them  a baby and an old wino  are miraculously still alive  they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab  where stone pressures the white house to call up a  directive    an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb  what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda  an organism that defies all the normal rules of earthlike life and mutates as it grows  their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict  what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the abomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet  they barely call off the bombing in time  but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out  this triggers the labs lastditch defense mechanism  an atomic bomb  to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days  the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow  much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts  but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw  the performances are universally fine  with the actors keeping things lowkey and restrained  just like scientists  to me  the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting  we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step  puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we dont expect  this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it  it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating  mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a bodys wrist is slashed  spilling its powdered blood  ,1,1
113,this film is based on the campy tv show from the s under the same appellation  mind you  most people  including yours truly  who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series  the movie is really a stand alone in that regard  the family robinson    lost in space  plot  set in the year   the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future  a colonization process  if you will  they are joined by able pilot west  leblanc   and evil uninvited stowaway  oldman   who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip  eventually  their trek goes awry  and all are  lost in space     how do get back to earth   is the question that infests the rest of this scifi epic  critique  this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element      from the summer of   its a film with a lot of flash  but very little actual substance  admittedly  there isnt an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film  but this film does run a little too long  and did lose me in regards to its complex timetravel  multidimensional story line  having said that  the special effects in this movie were amazing  and the overall look and feel were also way above average  you really felt like you were in the future  and riding through space with these poor souls  unfortunately for this chosen family  their year old son is the smartest one in the group  and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family  ever heard that one before  yawn    the acting is ok  and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friends matt leblanc who shows us all that hes definitely more than just a pretty face  on the down side  the family riffraff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and timeconsuming  even though we gotta give them credit for  trying  to develop characters in a scifi pic   the story line is hard to follow  the evil character in the movie actually tells people that hes  evil   and the movie goes on for about  minutes too long  on the slick side  many of the special effects are really cool  the sequence in which the family is  paralyzed  during the hyperdrive is awesome  and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool   the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming  and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling  i will also admit that  somehow  they got me to semitear up near the conclusion of this picture     very odd        overall  if youre a big scifi fan  check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative  and if youre not  i would still suggest seeing this movie  but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts  little known facts  this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic    out of the top spot at the boxoffice after  straight weeks at number one  garry oldman is british  and was once married to uma thurman for about six months  mimi rogers was tom cruises first wife  ,1,1
114,once upon a time jeanclaude van damme was a decent action hero  the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films  boasting his spectacular martialarts ability  some of these excursions were fun  but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore  with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mindnumbing action  and when the action goes sour  what is there left to enjoy  ill explain  knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong  marcus ray  van damme   a babemagnet and stylish dresser  heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner  rob schneider   they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans  seemingly by a mole in the business  im going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph  so if you want a review devoid of spoilers  skip onto the next one  im not quite sure who gives a crap  but ill issue a warning anyhow  tommy is really working with the cia  his boss  a very hammy and flat paul sorvino  is the mole  and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons  he even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys  if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing  then you probably will enjoy knock off  if you think that this ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing  this might not be your cup of tea  knock off sucks  it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares  it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something  simply because van damme is the star  the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind  the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe  and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe  director tsui hark  who teamed with van damme in the superior  but still lamebrained double team  is at the helm  and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot  i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work  but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous  the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence  speeds are altered consistently  and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired  it all sounds very cool  trust me  it isnt  as much as it scars me to say this  har  har   van damme is terrible  sure  he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease  he looks like hes doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan  and his performance is stiff and tired  i hate to say it  but perhaps its time for mr  van damme to give up his day job  its really a test of endurance watching knock off  i suppose theres some enjoyment derived from schneiders character  who is extremely annoying  but provides the films better moments  and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie  hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter  knock off doesnt even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film  like a handful of van dammes others  no  this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking  and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department  that is certainly not saying much  note to self  avoid universal soldier   the return upon release in august    ,0,0
115,to put it bluntly  ed wood would have been proud of this  a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor  hokey drama  zero logic and a crap screenplay  also  a beautifully anticlimactic ending  not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews  so much for truth in advertising  roland emmerich  whos later  independence day  would look like  the  blows  compared to this  cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens  in a useless opening sequence  men find a stone in  with hieroglyphics on it  it wouldnt be till present day    till they would actually figure it out  theyre decipherer  a slightlyneurotic scientist  nice twist   dr  dan jackson  james spader  doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare  whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word  why do they use him to decipher what no one else could  so there is a hokey ending  duh  he figures it out in about a minute  yea  and then they get a suicidal colonel or something   jack  oneill  kurt russel  with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position   why a suicidal colonel  for the ending  youll get the hang of this  they open the stargate  a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad  after an overdone special effects thing  theyre    inside a goddam pyramid  so they went to egypt  right  wrong  theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt  they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra  the sun god  the androginous jaye davidson  with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma   and there are fights  explosions and a kiss between two people  yea  also melodrama  stupidity  hokey scenes and a bizarre language  an anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines   say hello to king tut  asswhole    the quintessential line  lemme tell ya  and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development  by the end  you just wanna go home and watch  i dont know  the  outer limits  or something  the scripts terrible  the special effects are okay  but nothing great  the storys so weak that its almost opaque  the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a  full house  marathon    or this  id pick this  obviously  but still  its just not fun at all  and i cant wait for it to premier on mstk  ,0,0
116,tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out  minutes into the movie  the film  which opened in canada during  but was never released in the united states  is based on a  stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage  and  while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production  the translation to the screen is a creative disaster  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art  lifeless and tedious  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  tectonic plates has a storyline  although the narrative is developed in a decidedly nontraditional fashion  with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences  its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie  despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious  allbutscreaming   look  art     although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters  because were constantly made aware that were watching a play or a movie  its impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writers ideas  theyre not real  sympathetic  or believable  im willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different  but this particular experiment is not a success  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine  marie gignac   an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor  jacques  lapage   one day  he disappears  and  fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love  madeleine travels to venice to kill herself  while preparing to commit suicide  she encounters drug addict constance  celine bonnier   who causes madeleine to rethink her decision  meanwhile  jacques has moved to new york city  where he starts crossdressing  calls himself jennifer  and becomes a successful counterculture talkshow host  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland  supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deafmute  and cultural references that point to chopin  george sand  and jim morrison  tectonic plates is unique  if nothing else  however  as interesting as the film sounds  and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising   it never really delivers  the tone is soporific  the supposedlyintellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting  the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner  although it doesnt take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant   and the symbolism is obvious  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth  but it takes onehundred minutes to get across this transparent point  there are some worthwhile moments  such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages  although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual   the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because  a  its different   b  its not like anything theyve seen before  and  c  its pretentious  for everyone else  its not only a waste of time  but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage  ,0,1
117,elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mids  it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings  internally  the catholics wage war against the protestants  meanwhile  spain  scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power  little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth  cate blanchett  will be their greatest hope for survival  the film charts elizabeths tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom  as a protestant  she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen  but her halfsister queen mary  kathy burke   deathly ill and unable to conceive a child  pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne  mary gives her her blessing on only one condition  that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land  once declared queen  elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault  both by her own subjects  including the duke of norfolk  played with steelyeyed grace by christopher eccleston  and by forces abroad  slowly but surely  the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom  elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers  her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham  geoffrey rush  in a perfectly subtle performance   also on her side is sir william cecil  sir richard attenborough   her wellmeaning but misguided chief adviser  with few people she can trust  elizabeth must prove her selfworth any way she can  even if it means being the ironfisted ruler she secretly despises  blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth  she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky selfconsciousness and shrewd charisma  though not a classical beauty  blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk  she is at home with her characters playful tendencies  particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley  joseph fiennes   whether fending off unctuous suitors or  playing  the houses in court  blanchetts elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike  almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapurs visual delights  he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes  rolling green hills  extravagant ceremonial galas  dark and foreboding corridors  all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation  the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here  though writer michael hirsts script gets a little murky at times  and his injections of humor get a little overplayed  elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing  as a whole  the story survives because elizabeths struggle is one which deserves attention  by the time she makes her shocking  but very sensible  final declaration  were ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen  ,1,1
118,all those who were offended by theres something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie  a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch  and while this uproariously funny  grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste  it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season  i must question the studio that releases a movie like this  the producers are aiming these films at the  crowd  but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated film  some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc  a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie  american pie was threatened with an nc  but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product  it was given an r  but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park  it is sick  perverse  and ultimately disgusting  not to mention extremely funny  american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night  jim  jason biggs   kevin  thomas ian nicholas   oz  chris klein  and finch  eddie kaye thomas  are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead  jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base  to which one of his friends replies  like warm apple pie      of course  this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers  in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner  there are many moments  such as this  in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary  to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  american pie is a hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it  i loved the young cast in this movie  consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with  obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects  and you should appreciate their performances  biggs is more than enjoyable  and chris klein  who recently played a similar jock in election  is obviously a young talent on the rise  but in a teendominated movie  the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy  of televisions sctv   who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father  scenes in which the familiar fatherson conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie  after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie  he tells him  i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age  but i never used baked goods   it is performances such as his  and bill murrays in rushmore  that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out  there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the film  a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of exlax is something weve seen before  if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers  then this is a decidedly unwise move  the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber  and used to greater effect  secondly  the characters are forced into a halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing  but at one point  in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of its own  biggs asks his buddies why hes going through so much pressure for something thats not very important anyway   and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate  it still manages to be mature  in its own way  ,1,0
119,so much for sweet returns  after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative s slasher movies  starting with s  scream   and followed by  scream     urban legend   and the original   i know what you did last summer   a film like   i still know what you did last summer   was bound to be made sooner or late  it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out  and that is because they reached for the lowestcommondenominator in filmmaking  favoring nonstop deaths and gore for suspense  and trading in fleshed out  likable characters for onedimensional nitwits  it has been exactly one year since julie james  jennifer love hewitt  suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis  a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road  and then  thinking he was dead  dumped him into the ocean  since then  julie has relocated to boston university  and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams  she has been able to put her life back together  when julies friend  karla  brandy   is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is  she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people  which also includes karlas horny boyfriend  tyrell  mekhi phifer   and will  matthew settle   who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend  ray  freddie prinze jr   also returning from the original   doesnt show up  when they reach the secluded island  they discover it is the last day of the open season  and will be stranded there for the th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them  of course  julie  her friends  and the workers arent the only ones there  as the murderous ben willis  dressed in fisherman garb  returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all  it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like   i still know what you did last summer   is made  i am a very big fan of horror movies  and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to  ikwydls   which i am a fan of  is almost an exact replica of a  friday the th  movie  while the original focused more on the story and characters  as well as genuinely suspenseful moments  thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson  who didnt return to write the sequel  and it shows    i still know     has no story to speak of  and is so vacuous of ideas  that the filmmakers  were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested  also gone are any signs of character development  and since every single character died before i got to know them  all i was left with was to stare at the screen  indifferent to what was going on  while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original  it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died  they were all paperthin and pointless  except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman  another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setpieces  like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar  but there are none to speak of in this sequel  although they do come close at one moment with brandy   since so many people were killed every couple minutes  the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water  also of note is the mystery of the second killer  and accomplice to ben  but it is obvious from the first frame who it is  and so i couldnt even have fun at that  like i did in the  scream  movies and   urban legend   it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again  a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else  maybe the people who made   i still know what you did last summer   should have realized that in order to make a good movie  you must have a screenplayor at least one that isnt such a black hole for thoughts and ideas  the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part  but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel  everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead  ,0,0
120,     because im a scientist  thats what we do    dr  alexander mccabe  bob gunton   in response to why he created evil bats  alright folks  stop me if youve heard this one  genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals  assisted by a specialist in the particular animals field  must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth  oh yeah  the military is on their way to bomb the town as well  so they are running short on time  sound familiar  such is the plot of the destination films release of bats  dina meyer stars as the  bat specialist  sheila  who is pulled from her research  along with her annoying sidekick  played with irritating deftness by leon  in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently  with the help of the local sheriff  lou diamond phillips   a cdc official  carlos jacott   and a scientist  bob gunton   sheila discovers it is indeed bats  who have been genetically altered by guntons character to be more aggressive and omnivorous  in order to be used as a military weapon    i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  theres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  in this respect  the film never disappointed me  this film reaches a level that transcends the  so bad its good  level and borders on the downright insane  the effects are awful  the script is contrived  and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously  i think   i challenge anyone to sit through the scene  where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner  with a straight face  thankfully  the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with  dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in  johnny mnemonic  dragonheart  and starship troopers    the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit   and this one is no exception  while one never really gets the impression that meyers character could be a bat expert in reality  one never really cares to doubt it either  she gives as good a performance as could be expected  plus shes nice to look at for an hour and a half  lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here  as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero  although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for whats going on in town  for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats  the only bad performance in the film is that of leons  he is relegated to the  im not sticking around here   character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays  anyone who cant immediately tell that bob gunton  the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films  is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised  but i highly doubt it  even if he hadnt been the villain in just about every film hes ever been in  so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever  in fact  his death is welcome  because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  if the plot doesnt sound ridiculous to you yet  then check out these little tidbits  a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol  an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctors orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated  causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force  killing several townsfolk  a government official blows off shelias instructions  to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off  by pulling a night job  resulting in the death of an entire military unit  a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it  finally  to top it all off  this little texas town is showing nosferatu in its single screen theater  for reference  our town has over a million people in it with nearly  movie screens  and were lucky to even get kevin smiths dogma   the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the illconceived bat puppets  while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing  making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend whats going on   the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more lowkey  therefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic  rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  being able to see the puppeteers arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse  after all of this  if you still decide bats might be the movie for you  dont say you havent been warned  trust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in  shes definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these  ,0,0
121,stendhals syndrome  a condition where  in the presence of art  a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression  suicidal behaviour and personality disorder  grim stuff  to be sure  but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento  boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone  the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento  it follows his disappointing american debut trauma     the patchy opera    and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late s  based on the novel by graziella magherini  the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapistkiller  visiting florence to follow up several leads  she is lured by the killer alfredo  thomas kretschmann  to an art gallery  a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail  at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints  posing as a bystander  alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer  a strange game of cat and mouse begins  a gripping story evolves  and a coherent one  too  which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives  the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cophuntingkiller scenario  it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration  the script explores its psychosexual themes with intelligence and candour  perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers  but as dark as its themes are  the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years  argento is once again working in his native italy  and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences  effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here  and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent  the films opening  minutes segues between hallucination  flashback and realtime with tremendous style  proof that  at his most inspired  argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers  the cast is generally good  though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless  asia argentos performance is by turns risky  awkward and fascinating  its a difficult role  and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts  thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo  and marco leonardi  of cinema paradiso  and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy  does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest  but perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack  active since the s  morricone has scored over  films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts  its mostly a variation on the one theme  a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary  haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards  its been three decades since argento and morricone worked together  this is a long welcome reunion  if the film has a fault  it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax  but by the closing scenes  the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career    note  see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can  dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web  ,1,1
122,there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have  but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason    good will hunting  is about one of those people  the will hunting of the  horrible  title  lets face it  this film would be a bitch to title   played by cowriter matt damon  is a mathematical genius  he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino  and he works at mit    as the janitor  one day  the professor of one of the most challenging courses  proffessor lambeau   breaking the waves  s stellan skarsg  rd   puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete  the next day  its already done on the board  but no one in his class claims to have done it  so lambeau puts another problem on the board  this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove  and  duh  its done again  of course  they catch the guy who did it red handed  will  before lambeau can find will again  he ran away when he caught him   will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court  and struck a police officer  so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements  a  he work with him on math  and b  he get some therapy  after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another  for a hypnotist  he fakes being under his spell  then launches into an impromptu performance of the s classic   afternoon delight    finally  lambeaus old college roomate  sean mcguire  robin williams   a psych professor  agrees to treat him  and the two begin a rocky relationship  as sean tries to get will to open up  turns out will had a rough childhood  being abandoned  and placed in foster homes and what not  it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life  he wants a challenge  and that is to hang out with his buds  including the other cowriter  ben affleck   and do honorable jobs  like construction  is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky  should this guy be forced to do something he doesnt want to do  this appears to be one of the million questions in this film  which is jampacked with greatness  but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should  im not saying  good will hunting  is a bad film at all  its a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments  and lots of great things about it  the acting is amazing  with two oscarnominationworthy performances from damon and williams  who have amazing chemistry together  we also get some great support from stellan skarsg  rd  great name   ben affleck  and from minnie driver  who plays wills love interest  skylar  there are tons of individual moments that i adored  i loved all the comedy in the film  especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks  his various attempts at therapy  and of course  my favorite scene in the entire film  the one where he delivers a long  exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them  i liked the relationship between some of the people  like will and skylar  will and sean  sean and lambeau  and will and his friends  there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch  and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal  that i felt rightfully uncomfortable  like the breakup scene between will and skylar  will and seans first meeting  a bar scene between sean and lambeau  and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesnt regret meeting his first wife  who would later suffer a slow  painful death  and leave him lonely and slightly bitter  however  the main flaw of the film is theres too much of everything  and not enough of it either  the film tries for deeper relations between the characters  but theyre sometimes either overwritten or underwritten  take for example the relationship between sean and will  the film gets an interesting fatherson as well as doctorpatient relationship going with out any problems  but when it tries to show them as equals  it falls on its face  we hear how they went to the same town  and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  also  wills relationship with his best friend  chuckie  affleck   has a nice climax  but not enough rising action  we see them joking around  but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them  it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one  their relationship never goes beyond  just best friends   and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more    human  maybe it was just me  and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau  but that  again  is underwritten  and  of course  as in most films like this  the girlboy relationship is pretty underwritten  we never understand what they see in each other  so when skylar confesses that she loves him  it seems more like its there for plot details that anything else  minnie driver is interesting  though  and breathes life into her character  the writing is a bit at fault here  but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness  sure  it feels overstuffed  but its extremely enjoyable  the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh  and seems extremely human  i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue  which is amazing  while this is probably director gus van sants most conservative film  youd hardly know its the same director of  to die for   the only van sant film ive seen  really   its still a pretty remarkable film  albeit a tad overrated  whats this  best picture  deal    and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws  i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone  ,1,1
123,catherine deane  jennifer lopez  is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up  she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma  but the boys parents arent happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life  as if trying to assure the boys parents wasnt hard enough on her  a new development arises that furthers the strain on deanes mental faculties  a vicious serial killer named carl stargher  vincent donofrio  has been kidnapping women  locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days  then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into lifesized dolls  just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell  stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia  the police  led by fbi agent peter novak  vince vaughn  are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victims body  but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state  in a last ditch attempt  they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    a cell which will completely fill with water in the next  hours  initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  while it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  the buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  all of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  the first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   in my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   the newton boys  feeling minnesota  the thirteenth floor  and the velocity of gary  that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though  and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  besides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  a sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  as a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  as a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  unfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv  provided  of course  that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos   ,1,1
124,for more than a decade  anjelica huston has been one of americas finest actresses  in her directorial debut  bastard out of carolina  based upon dorothy allisons largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south  huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well  the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright  nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth  in postworld war ii south carolina  through voiceover  narration done by laura dern   we find that she nearly didnt survive birth  as her single mother anney  played by jennifer jason leigh  was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident  thats just the beginning of her troubles  bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate  a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come  anney meets and weds lyle  a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident  anneys brother earle  played by michael rooker  introduces her to glen  played by ron eldard  a coworker at the mill  glen  the black sheep of a wealthy family   when are you gonna make your daddy proud  ill tell you when  never   hes told  and filled with bitterness  courts anney and eventually wins her  despite warnings of a violent temper  when anney miscarries with his muchprized baby boy  glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone  beating and abusing her  while the lovedependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour  things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment  while set several decades ago  this story remains completely relevant in todays society  where abused wives return to their husbands  and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other  the real star of this domestic drama is not topbilled jennifer jason leigh  but child actress jena malone  who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance  her work is of awardcalibre  and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged  kirsten dunst  tina majorino  anna paquin  natalie portman  christina ricci  elijah wood   malones performance stands up well  leighs performance in bastard out of carolina is fine  although shes not really given much to do  and ron eldard work is very solid  skillfully manouvering his characters moods in and out of explosive rage  one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressurecooker ticking away  of the supporting cast  special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rookers performance  theres a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste  from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms  to the familiar sight of a driedup uptight wise old granny  played by grace zabriskie  sitting on the porch rocking chair  to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance  still  it cannot be denied that anne merediths screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power  hustons direction of the film is surehanded and impressive  giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast  particularly the young malone  her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hardhitting emotional  rather than graphic  manner  and are very effective  hustons talent with camera positioning is wonderful  from a visually striking shot done through a fan  to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile  the film has the toneddown feel of a television production  bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station  who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience  perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant  but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing  ,1,1
125,jeanluc picard  patrick stewart  and the rest of the crew of the u  s  s  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the s series  star trek  gone are kirk  spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek  the next generation  as usual  a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f  murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonists will  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong  so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction  it doesnt do a bad job  other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trekfanonly jokes  while many of the others just fall flat  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet  why do they have to be moved  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f  murray abrahams aliens who number only a couple of dozen  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion  at least thats plausible  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen  which makes no sense whatsoever  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf  michael dorn   the trusty klingon  worf was on star trek  the next generation  so they want to include him in the films  no problem so far  worf is now a character of star trek  deep space nine  so the writers have to find a way to have him show up  in the last star trek movie  first contact  the included worf in a credible fashion  in this one  the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you werent hanging on every word on the screen  my minor problems with the movie aside  star trek  insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones  while many of the jokes do miss the mark  many are pretty good  even for nontrekkies  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series  the action is plentiful and well done  this is a very goodlooking movie  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek  the next generation that the acting is first rate  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series  if youve always hated star trek  there is nothing here that is going to change your mind  star trek  insurrection is not the best film in the series  but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones  ,1,0
126,john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles  so effortlessly that people tend to forget hes there  much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors  anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actors face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors   example  the other day my mother asked me  the expert  of course  if there were any movies out worth seeing  never mind that our tastes couldnt be more divergent ill never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes  and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go  was a lot of fun  which it is   so i didnt see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation  i muttered  with a little trepidation  that she might enjoy high fidelity  she responded with her usual query   whose in that one   this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see  if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light  a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing  and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people  usually of the jewish faith  fretting about in some upper east side palace  anyway  when i answered  john cusack   she replied with a rather stunned  who    as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to  now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies  most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin  but i suppose its understandable that she would not recognize the name  after all  for most  names are tougher than faces  i showed her a picture of cusacks mug in the paper hoping for an  oh  him  yes hes quite good  instead i got a  no  i dont know him   at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger  yes  filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone   till i realized something  i doubt that much of america would recognize cusacks relatively bland visage  or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise  onesyllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car  cusack  cusack  no  not quite as cool  im sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as  the guy from  add in the cusack film of your choice    hes not a brand name  and his movies usually arent big moneymakers  but in his own unassuming way hes kind of a genius  with his pleasant  common man looks  and charming semiarticulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the s  from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon  despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it  the schlumpy every man   hes a constantly enjoyable screen persona  like albert brooks or woody allen  and he knows how to chose scripts  while the stephan baldwins and val kilmers seem to put them selves in everything  the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle  and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent   cusack generally picks rewarding projects  save for the unwatchable hot pursuit  a  film also featuring a young ben stiller   high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears  the grifters  the hilo country   and its a hit  it was also cowritten by cusack  and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy  grosse point blank  its not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film  but as it progresses in its meandering fashion  the movie cast something of a spell over me  high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the noncommittal rob  a vinyl record store owner  who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his  top  break ups list   this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris buellers day off  at first the talkingdirectlyintothecameraschtick had me vaguely annoyed  mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit  but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusacks witty delivery  hes the kind of guy we dont mind talking directly to us  gradually the film settles into a shampoolike tragicomic character study  of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is  yes its all very existential   though that plotline is mostly enjoyable  the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters  all of whom  now this is really something  are terrific enough to warrant their own films  the best of which is jack black  of the very funny show tenacious d  a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair    unfortunately that annoying smirk remains   an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy  hes the kind of guy im sure weve all met before  a blowhard who thinks hes always right and will do anything in his power  be it yell  argue  insult  to hoist his opinion onto others  but i like this guy  because of how black plays him  the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes  but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak  which might be a bit of a redundant description  seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic   hes the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films    look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister   but fears and black never let that happen  the character  for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality  hes over the top  but in a way we can all probably relate to  catherine zetajones  in her brief role  gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own  charm   tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new agetype  a character played entirely for cartoon yuks  but still manages to work its desired comic effect  the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy  the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle  mifune   who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent  replacing it with a stilted american phonation  i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role  but instead of being likeable  she comes across as rather robotic  and as such its hard to see why cusacks character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful  intelligent writer  natasha gregson wagner  potentially waiting in the wings  this reminded me of say anything  where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye  and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood  whose unbelievably more wooden then father  clint for those  special people  whose wheels turn a little slower   in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his  though id bet that if laura and natasha switched roles  the result would be more effective  high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances  fears direction is somewhat stilted  and the script is sometimes a little too  and this is a word im beginning to hate to use but alas i must  quirky for its own good  i think ill blame that on scott rosenberg  who judging from what he did with beautiful girls  con air  and things to do in denver while your dead  has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie   but cusack really does deserve an award  for being so damn    cusackian  im afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent  his character  rob  whose sort of like an older  more bitter lloyd from say anything  is funny and tragic without being pathetic  and that cusack can do all this  and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences  is something of an achievement  ,1,1

128,robert redfords a river runs through it is not a film i watch often  it is a masterpiece  one of the better films of recent years  until   it was my second favorite film of all time  the acting and direction is topnotch  never sappy  always touching  a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because  i was afraid it would just be really politically correct  and tick me off   all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased  and enjoy  it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears  but certain memories should not often be rereleased  in the last few shots  you have to cry  upon my first viewing i left bawling  it is not flawless  but it is so very good  that you cant help but be effected  the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental  watching these shots of people who have been dead so long  gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films  martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state  like taking dope  and immersing yourself in an alternative world  that is what a river runs through it does  it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self  both times ive seen it  its been hard  again to quote scorsese  waking up  but the dream is lovely  ,1,1
129,the reunion film is not an original idea in any way  shape  or form  its been done throughout film history over and over again  and has become one of the many subgenres  like the prep school subgenre  the angstfilled teen subgenre  and the slasher subgenre  what makes  peters friends  so remarkable is not how it doesnt follow the rules of this subgenre  but how it follows it so well  and creates characters that i wouldnt mind hanging with  what are the rules of the reunion subgenre  well       you need a group of friends  most of them married or at least dating  and sometimes even married or dating eachother    you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis    they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart    the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by     they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic    the reunion has to bring them together  seperate them with little crises  then bring them back together because  after all  theyre friends    there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited    eightly  theyre all unhappy or marginally so    theres some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them thats built up over the years    the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts  sometimes internationally so    the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends  sometimes causing them to get together in dancesong  since it follows these rules so closely  it will probably be  and has been  coined off as just a  british big chill    and in some ways it is  both follow the rules  as i said  and both feature lots of bitching  big confessionals  and broken relationships  but while  the big chill  was  at least to me  a tad too whiny and unsatisfying   peters friends  hits its mark  making this film funny  dramatic  and poignant  the friends of peters were all in the same theatre group back in   performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them  the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus   after peters  stephen fry  wealthy father  richard briers  hardly on screen enough to register  but oh well  dies  leaving a giant mansion to him  he has to decide whether or not to keep it  not sure what to do with it immeadiately  he decides to throw a giant reunion party  inviting back all his old chums  of course  all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule  andrew  kenneth branagh  also directing here  is an actor whos unhappily married to a tv star  carol  cowriter rita rudner   maggie  emma thompson  is a successfuly publisher of selfhelp books  but looks like she needs them more than her customers  as she is lonely and unhappy  roger and mary  hugh laurie and imelda staunton  who were also married in  sense and sensibility   are married  and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk  but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died  and sarah  alphonsia emmanuel  is as promiscuous as ever  having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian  tony slattery  whos married and wants a divorce because of her  giving her doubts  as for peter  things seem okay    the film features lots of innerfriend jokes  and even some old theatre anecdotes  which i at least find a lot of fun in  as ive done lots of theatre myself   and there are big confessions  brawls between the friends  and by the end  almost everyone is unhappy  even though some have resolved their problems long before the end  which i kinda dug   the final twist would seem forced an anticlimactic  but for some reason  i felt the same way the rest of the friends did  maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  thats really what makes  peters friends  so lovable  the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes  but when someones in crisis  can come together wonderfully for one another  its when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends  and these people are true friends  not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the s  a decade i grew up in  unfortunately  without taking us outside of the s  there are some s classics and anticlassics like tears for fears  everybody wants to rule the world   but unfortunately no stupidfun s songs  i think if i ever did an s reunion film  id put some crap go gos song on  or at least some good old  come on eileen    but this is the british s were talking about  oh well  but anyway  the direction is pretty good  although nothing amazing  branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical  but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this  the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman  with lots of good oneliners  and even some really bad but good puns  to mock the fact that andrew lives in l  a   peter  while cutting some logs  asks him is he has wood in l  a   and andrew says   no  but we have hollywood   punishment like that   the actors  as in most speaking movies  are better than their material  though  with some standout performances to the six friends  as well as the outsiders like slattery  rudner  and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peters mansion  a little note should be made about hugh lauries performance  as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this  i mean  ive never seen him actually act this dramatically    peters friends  is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion  although i dont know what kind ill have  like most people  i dont look forward to my high school reunion   because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation  i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that  ,1,1
130,i guess its a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour  could not be ruined even by the nauseating  comedy  of chris tucker  im a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium  and this movie lets him not only do his impressiveasever martial arts schtick  but show off his comic timing as well  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects  this time around  the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan  john lone   who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states  im still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that  is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones    the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns  of course  its up to hong kong detective lee  chan  and trashtalking lapd detective james carter  tucker  to take the bad guys out and the authorities  to the extent that they even exist  stay out of their way  rush hour  turns the tables on the first film in that here its carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan  he refuses to shut up  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head  but his jokes just arent funny  a pathetic mixture of subpar eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock whitemanblackman jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates  but didnt anyone realize how irritating tuckers incessant ranting and raving was  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i dont care to see any more of his films  fortunately  chan makes for a marvelous straight man  and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely  its not often that one actor can so completely save a movie  but there is no other name for what he does  whenever hes on screen  rush hour  comes to nearly breathtaking  often hilarious  life  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a  player   but who cares  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier  the movie ends with outtakes that  as usual  show that chan isnt perfect  and that it does  indeed  take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless  chris tucker botches some lines as well  and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour  isnt very different from its predecessor in tone or style  but i liked the original  and i like the sequel  though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it  director brett ratner  the family man  keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes  i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works   its not great jackie chan  but its jackie chan  and thats enough  up next  jay and silent bob strike back ,1,0
131,ingredients  pouring rain  small flooded town  damn about to burst  bad guys going after millions of dollars synopsis  at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom what happened to her church  he replies something like   the church is flooded but at least the floodwaters put out the big fire  well  the fire wasnt that bad  since  while the church was burning  looters apparently thought it was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass windows   in hard rain a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding  everyone has had to evacuate because its raining  and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break  enter a working class smartalecky new armored car driver named tom  christian slater   suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters  tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money  hide it  and swim for his life  this makes for an action movie full of jet skis  speedboat chases  and gun battles  as tom tries to evade and outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the national guard can answer his distress call  he is befriended and aided by a spunky churchgoing young woman from town named karen  minnie driver   but unknown to tom and karen  the national guard never heard toms initial distress call  will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters  opinion  dont expect thoughtprovoking issues or dramatics  theres not much more to this movie than hiding  running  swimming  shooting  and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning  but thats what makes it escapist and fun  relax  take your shoes off  and break out the popcorn  ,1,0
132,as i walked out of crouching tiger  hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film  with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a  great  piece of work and viceversa  attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs  i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology  as the word implies  a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master  as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality  crouching tiger  hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category  crouching tiger  hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore  with the requisite blend of legend  fantasy  magic and mythology  it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be halfgods  greater than life  purer than life  stronger than life  physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats  but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable  all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix  including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement  the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop  with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil  which must choose between the two  it is the gifted pupil who  under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend  the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment  a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters  are poignantly represented  the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively  the fight scenes are stunning balletic toursdeforce  not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art  as are the prodigious leaps and flights to  from and between rooftops  the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake  there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry  as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line  which takes place at an ordinary human level  yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy  do not assume  however  that the art is limpwristed  for those who are put off by the  art  label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure  action and romance  there are no weak performances in this movie  michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth  humanity and wisdom  chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart  zhang ziyi is a budding superstar  she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role  cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably  kudos to screenwriters james schamus  wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing  choreographer yuen woping  photography director peter pau and music director tan dun  each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film  ang lee as the director  coproducer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit  this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes  including those who hate martial arts movies  dont miss it  ,1,1
133,i can imagine how good krippendorfs tribe must have looked on paper  it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors  led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director  todd holland   all wanted to make this film  in fact  it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorfs tribe as possible  in retrospect  i can imagine how bad this film could have been  i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  dreyfuss plays james krippendorf  an anthropologist who is granted    by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea  halfway into his twoyear expedition  his wife  apparently  dies  i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established  later  we find out that much of the grant money was spent on bigscreen tvs and other such pleasures  so  when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely  he decides to construct an elaborate lie  he makes his own tribe  using his three children as actors in a video  he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe  which he calls the shelmickedmu   audiences at krippendorfs lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision  and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  like all films like this  the lie becomes more and more complex  and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero  dreyfuss is a funny  talented man  and he is funny in this film  he has lots of positive energy and  unlike most comical actors  really manages to play people like this realistically  this film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform  and he does a great job  jenna elfman  who plays veronica mecilli  a scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work  is also very funny and appealing here  and the kid actors are great  as well  but were talking about the script from hell  this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  no  the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  furthermore  the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  take  for instance  the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  they get all decked out in the tribe getup  complete with paint to darken their skin  krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  now  i saw this scene coming from a mile away  but i said to myself   no  that would be far too tasteless  theres no way theyll do that    oh god   they did do it  its there  i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didnt bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  i found it deplorable  and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it  he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  the film is filled with scenes like these  they not only insult the audience  but they insult the types of people that the film portrays  it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists  yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon  and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining  but i think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes  if i were an anthropologist  this film would insult me immensely  moving right along  the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes  sure  dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny  and it allows for some entertaining scenes  but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes  it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film  his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar  and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does  i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case  but for the purposes of good taste  i would have expected something  no  this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues  and the writer of the film  charlie peters  didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad  in fact  its his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing  and he continually shrugs off her warnings  i suppose its important to admit that this is a funny film  dreyfuss and elfman  and many of the contrived and insulting scenes  add up to a picture that is anything but boring  and if youre less serious than i  you probably will enjoy it  i  however  cant get past these elements  krippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy  but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldnt be learning  with a little more insight into its story and themes  this could have been a good movie  ,0,0

136,the sequel to the fugitive     u  s marshals is an average thriller using its association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard  the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive  this time  hes after fugitive mark sheridan  snipes  who the police think killed two fbi agents  but of course hes been set up  and when the police plane escort he  and gerard  are riding crashes  he makes a run for it  gerard not so hot on his tail  what follows is about  hours of action  brought to us by the director of executive decision     another film curiously involving a plane  when comparing this movie to the fugitive  the prequel is far superior  but even on its own  u  s marshals is a pretty lousy movie  while the original was reasonably intelligent  and had a fugitive to root for  the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive  mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character  u  s marshals is straight in there  pulling its trump card  the place crash  almost immediately  to be honest  i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not  snipes performance is average  and his character gets surprisingly little screen time  considering he is the fugitive  for reasons ill explain later  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever  although his role is hardly a challenge  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  i know its the same role from the fugitive  but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film  theres a few nudge nudge references from the first film  but apart from that  nothing  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce whos roped into the chase  and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife  nobody looks as if their having a good time  and all the performers are on autopilot  the supporting cast are o  k  but when it comes to performances  u  s marshals falls flat on its face  it doesnt fare any better plotwise  either  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes  but then veers off into terrorists territory  as said above  the film is an normal  average terrorist thriller  seen a million times before  but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional  if this film wasnt the sequel to the fugitive  this would probably go straight to video  or not even been made at all  because its so average  and because of the films plot changing its course  snipes is almost forgotten apart  and hardly features in the movie  stuart baird  the director  is all right  but theres no particular scene that stands out  its director is the usual action movie style  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension  the special effects are nice  especially the plane crash  and theres a good  if very loud  soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith  but in the end  u  s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement  sure  its loud and dumb  but in the end u  s marshals just aint fun  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script  do not make a good action movie  overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities ,0,0
137,ok  i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start  a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents  with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure  yuck  but its not really too bad  it has a lot working against it  for me at least  in addition to the above  it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified madefortv movie  but longer and with bigger stars  and you have to pay to see it  it does win you over  though  even if it is painfully predictable  just think about it  two single parents  with their cute kids  are thrown together due to a missed field trip  through a day of near disasters  they cont inually meet  get in one anothers way  cause trouble for one another  and generally insult one another at every opportunity  in fact  they hate each other so much that we know that they are  or soon will be  in love  the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples  so this film is predictable  just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable  and the screwball genre is obviously hoffmans model for this film   will they get fired from their yuppie jobs  will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids  will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her exhusband  a drummer for bruce springsteen  really is  arent they all    will they finally kiss  well  what do you expect  but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled  especially when it is done with as much humour  along with a lack of sticky sentimentality  as it is in this film  pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming  and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show  one word of caution  though  this film is being billed in some places as a  family  movie  dont let that stop you  however  i think most kids  especially boys  would be pretty bored by this move  after all  nobody gets killed and there are no explosions  all in all  a good  nonoffensive date movie  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  ,1,0

144,one of the responses those that enjoy  detroit rock city   probably kiss fans  mostly  might have upon first glance at the rating ive given the film might be something like   oh  that caseys gone and become a jaded critic on us  just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n roll movie like this   im wondering the same thing  i feel like i should have had a grand time with  detroit rock city   its the sort of movie i wish i couldve had a lot of fun with  but i didnt  i just didnt  surely this film isnt trying to win any major awards  so should i have expected an oscarcaliber film  no  but i expected something  a funny joke  a clever prank  a plot development  anything  the movie never delivers  youve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing    detroit rock city  is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent  minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence  and its not a very satisfying realization  the film is about four teenage boys  all huge kiss fans from cleveland  trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit  michigan  thats it  there is no big plot description in this review  because the movie has very little plot  the characters are hawk  edward furlong   lex  giuseppe andrews   trip  james debello   and jam  sam huntington   they have a garage band  theyre pathetic  like all garage bands  but they like kiss and they like rock n roll  so i guess that means we root for them  they have tickets  they lose them  they get more tickets  they lose those too  they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets  most of which backfire  theres not much more to it  frankly  it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film  when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands  only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity  oh  and jam  real name jeremiah  has a really  really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  she doesnt want them to see kiss  if you hadnt figured that out already  its really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  weve got plenty of kiss  along with some acdc  ramones  and thin lizzy  then again   maximum overdrive  had an awesome soundtrack  me being the big acdc fan that i am   but is probably one of the worst movies of all time    detroit rock city  doesnt quite reach that level of ineptitude  but it gets dangerously close  in fact  the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  basically  the soundtrack has earned the film a full halfstar  which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back  except for marilyn manson  whose halfhearted cover of acdcs  highway to hell  sounds like something my neighbors cat coughed up   its also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste  because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie  edward furlong has done far better work than this  and so has natasha lyonne  and so has lin shaye  but hey  theyve got to make a living in hollywood  people wanting to see kiss  and lots of it will probably be disappointed  considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  too bad  they might have provided some energy to this mess  director adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with  so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  we get an endless parade of quickcuts  splitscreens  zoomouts  zoomins  and rotating cameras  all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script  its fun for a while  but eventually it becomes disorienting  i would recommend that those who felt seasick at  the blair witch project  stay far away from  detroit rock city   because the witch has got nothing on this baby  i havent felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since  armageddon   and what about that script  its written by carl j  dupr   which sounds like as madeup a name as ive ever heard  if it is  i cant say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible  a plotless  pointless rock n roll movie can be fun  if the jokes and gags are actually funny  the jokes in  detroit rock city  rarely are  in fact  the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuanalaced pizza  and that was just because it was so surreal  the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it  comedy   there is no setup  just a succession of punchlines that dont provide for much in the way of chuckles  precisely because there was no setup  its as if they just whacked someone on the head  pointed at him and said   see  funny   look  that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink  see  funny  look  that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver  twice  see  funny  look  that kid has been vomiting for  minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money  see  funny  a word of advice to mr  dupr   no  these things arent funny all by themselves  they must be preceded by a clever setup so the audience hasn t predicted them five minutes in advance  thats it  ive said enough about this movie  its a waste of time and money  i liked the music  but dont bother buying the soundtrack  i hear it s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie  you want to see this concept executed well  go rent roger cormans  classic  rock n roll high school   it features another lateseventies rock band  the ramones  and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show  yes  go rent that  and skip  detroit rock city   which will probably bomb  and deservedly so  ,0,0
145,my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one  but in fact the third installment  it was the first to gain a national theatrical release   i didnt see the first film until much later  so looking back  the original didnt hold a lot of great memories for me  since i didnt think too much of it when i initially saw it  watching it now for a second time confirmed that its an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever  you all know the story by now  child murderer freddy krueger  robert englund  returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before  this first installment does an adequate job with its low budget  but theres some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story  plus the movies ending  understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a  hook  for a sequel  renders the rest of the film pointless  and does anyone understand what happens to nancys mother at the end of this film  dont get me wrong though    its not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics  most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is  horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly  and a nightmare on elm street just doesnt cut it  a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video  it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set  the film is presented in both pan and scan and its original theatrical aspect ratio of       although on the disc that comes in the box set  only a widescreen transfer is provided   the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio  a mono mix and a new dolby digital    mix  also included on the dvd is a fulllength audio commentary track with writerdirector wes craven  stars john saxon and heather langenkamp  and the films director of photography  other extras include the  jump to a nightmare  feature  im sure you can figure that one out   the usual cast and crew bios  which are from the films original press release kit  and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp    and the films original theatrical trailer  some dvdrom features are also included  but since i dont have dvdrom capabilities i cant really get into that  the commentary track is entertaining and informative  but nothing spectacular  the first thing of note is that its the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago  im not saying thats a negative thing  just pointing it out  everyone seems enthusiastic about being there  with the possible exception of john saxon  who just doesnt say much at all  most of the time youll forget hes even there  everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason  as if because theyre commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible  the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about  minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series  also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film    however you can only access one easily  the other is hidden in whats called  the labyrinth   which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created  basically  its an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage  interviews  etc  somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film  finding it though is both a chore and a bore  r ,0,1
146,the following review encompasses two versions of dune  dune  the theatrical version    runtime   minutes capsule review  cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives  the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  the films visual splendour  mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative  dune  the extended version    runtime   minutes capsule review  a bit of a throwtogether assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television  it was disowned by director david lynch but its considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline  quality dubs of this version from the outofprint japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web      the review    released in  and made on a then mammoth budget of  million  the film of frank herberts cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by scifi fans  director david lynch  blue velvet  eraserhead  twin peaks  was working on his biggest production to date  a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico  the screenplay was lynchs own  chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected  dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors  the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis  dune   a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange  the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe  it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it  most importantly  it allows the navigators of the spacing guild  once human but now hideously mutated  to  fold space  and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  lynchs film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the storys two main strands  one is the longstanding rivalry between two families  houses atreides and house harkonnen  and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis  the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah longawaited by the natives of arrakis  the fremen  the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld  and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom  unfortunately  this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  which runs  to  minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended  the thinking among universals ohsowise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office  with lynchs initial cut running at closer to three or more hours  the studio demanded that further cuts be made  what a great idea  why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible  the most glaring consequence of this oneeyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative  leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters  thus their personalities are vague  their motivations unclear and  in the case of pauls father duke leto  their demise rather meaningless  the end result is a distinct chill  we cant warm to most of the cast and we dont care much for them  and it hardly helps that the voiceover narration is sparse and that the duneesque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book  dune is also a very serous film  the constant  selftalk  by various characters makes it so serious and selfabsorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment  the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  humour  or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad  sadistic kind  is hard to find  you may balk at the comparison  but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy  the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  however  it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi  special effects whiz carlo rambaldis giant sandworms are an awesome sight  both the production design  anthony masters  and costume design  bob ringwood  are striking and original  and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years  with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography  the film is at least a feast for the senses  see it in the widescreen format if you can  and despite all the cuts  several cast members still make a strong impression  most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam  leader of the bene gesserit religious order whos secret aim is to manipulate pauls destiny for its own shadowy ends  as paul atreides  the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily  but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  the conclusion  any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herberts original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker  david lynch took a brave stab at it and  partly due to forces beyond his control  ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects  dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release  many chose to stay away altogether  as the films disastrous box office showing attests  the extended version  however  is a rather different beast  in  lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  directors cut  of the film on home video  a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres  but  alas  he failed to do so  choosing to move on to other projects  in a way  then  it is partly lynchs own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version  put together in  by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa  stung into action  lynch successfully petitioned the directors guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with  allen smithee   the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work  he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous  judas booth   certainly  looking at the results of mcas handiwork theres at least half a dozen instances that  for sheer technical sloppiness  are good enough reasons for the director to object  but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas  most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration  both of which fill many holes in the original versions storyline  pauls relationship with his father and associates is more intimate  with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously  the political skulduggery involving the emperor  the spacing guild  the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained  pauls initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably  and as further background  a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe  as a piece of storytelling  then  mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior  as a piece of editing  however  it is at times surprisingly inept  the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough  but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  theres some sloppy cutting  too  and in a few instances shots even appear out of order  and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes  eg  ships coming and going  soldiers coming and going  is at times clearly outofcontext  this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected  and rightly so  it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s  television  but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasnt even in herberts book  the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his  heart plug   its a surreal and disturbing episode thats very lynchesque but adds nothing to what we already know  the baron is a nasty piece of work  despite its own peculiar flaws  then  the extended version of dune is a generally superior film  all up  it contains  minutes of restored footage and approximately another  minutes of either altered  fabricated or newly created sequences  unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart  the  alan smithee  version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been  on repeated viewings  one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit  still  as one of this centurys great sciencefiction novels  some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen  with rumours circulating of a new six hour miniseries planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in   it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga  ,0,1

find a young boy  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  and his slave mother  quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing  anakin participates in a heartpounding podrace  one of the highlights of the film  to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship  however  most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy  meanwhile  queen amadala  natalie portman  is frustrated and at wits end  being na  ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders  there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training  the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb  this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made  in all the star wars films  human emotions that we  the audience  can identify with are usually nil  but the films are for pure enjoyment  not for uplifting purposes  despite the fun of watching the movie  the phantom menace is not without flaws  for starters  we have the illconceived  moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience  what a klutz  george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as  say  yoda  rd  or cpo  but  alas  his efforts were in vain  secondly  this may be good or bad  depending on your point of view   the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments  this is due  perhaps  to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here  the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions  i cant say much about the acting  though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway  however  there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and  at times  stale  natalie portman has a great presence  but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic  unfeeling  enigma  there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance  jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk  despite the inevitable faults  there is so much to enjoy about the movie  the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesnt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes  but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite  the film is a treasure to look at  the visual effects are astonishing    of the time the aweinspiring  mouthopening  eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius  not since s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one  the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element  the previous star wars movies  kubricks   maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis  however  all the sets are so original  the original star wars movies cant even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode  the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them  whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers  or the jedis simple brown uniforms  the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness  the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  as for john williams score  i dont think hes done one as complex or powerful since  i cant even remember  it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws  it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films  but williams has added on  made the music much more intense and moving  what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie  one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed  there is very little to hate in the film  its a very accomplished and skillfully made flick  it is the best  fun  film and the best bigbudget film out today  most definitely  ,1,1
149,the question isnt why has grease been reissued  the answer to that one is easy  to celebrate the movies th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramounts coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity  no  the question that ought to be asked is  should grease be reissued  the answer is not an easy one  grease is a fun movie  an entertaining fantasy of the s  embodying all the cliches of that era  the music is lively and the dance numbers  choreographed by patricia birch  are energetic and highspirited  travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon  cool  but nonthreatening  but grease didnt break any new cinematic ground  it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider  what grease is  or has become  is the highestgrossing musical in film history  ok  lets not be a spoilsport  grease is a fun and entertaining movie  even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta  olivia newtonjohn  taxis jeff conaway and the multitalented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers  its nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was  and its sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career  he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly  cinematically  the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur  between grease and s evita   you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand  two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre  the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated  no  make that cynical and jaded  today  if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight  he or she would probably be hooted off the screen  todays audiences lack the innocence  that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed  secondly  a lack of talent  performers with the charisma  the style  the largerthanlife panache of fred astaire  gene kelly  ginger rogers and judy garland are gone  most singers and dancers remain on the stage  and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts  a good example is gregory hines  one of the greatest dancers in the world  he danced a bit in the cotton club  tap and white nights  but those were essentially dramatic vehicles  so  perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose  if audiences show enough interest  meaning if the rerelease earns the studio enough revenue  it may spark a revival in movie musicals  perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain  an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers  but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years  at one time or another  according to the industry rumor mill  hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webbers cats  a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago  the latter reportedly to star madonna  so  let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals  let grease be the word that sparks this revival  ,1,0
150,titantic  writer and director james camerons much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed      epic  arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises  whether the film is worth it  as a business proposition  it seems hard to see how it can ever break even  but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  if youve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure  think again  the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the worlds most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers  in either case  it is filmmaking at its best  when we entered the press screening  my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long  he said no but that the time would go by so fast shed never notice the length  amazingly  he was right  titanic is one of the few long films that doesnt suffer because of it  the lush picture  filmed by russell carpenter in mm  opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean  fortune hunter brock lovett  bill paxton  leads the expedition looking for the worlds most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship  known back then as  the ship of dreams   the necklaces hundredyearold former owner  rose dewitt bukater  gloria stuart   finds brock to tell him her story  although almost all of the movie happens in flashback  one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk  using a computer simulation  the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later  which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing  after twenty minutes  the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage  in a classic movie theme  the two parts of the ship  first class and steerage  thirdclass  exist in sharp contrast  the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing  entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance  cal hockley  played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane  and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand  an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class  even with her own promenade deck  rose feels trapped on the ship  what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes  in contrast  jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board  after jack saves rose from committing suicide  they start a brief but impassioned love affair  never tawdry and rarely explicit  their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story  leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma  in so many ways  small and large  he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part  when he confronts cal  for example  he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cals supercilious putdowns  kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose  the chemistry between these two academy award nominees  him for whats eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility  is nothing short of astonishing  from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ships bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude  they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances  if the film breaks after an hour and a half  which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up  you will still get one of the best films of the year  peter lamonts sets are more than authentic  one scene  for example  starts with the planningtoretire captain  played with insouciance by bernard hill  having his tea on deck  it then shifts to the ships massive gears and then to the brighthot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals  the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner  easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest  at first  since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull  not some big gaping hole  the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else  what a lark  weve struck an iceberg  now lets get back to our brandy and cigars  the ships musicians play like troopers through it all  even after the panic sets in  after all  they see it as their duty to calm the passengers  when the musicians are about to die  they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together  and they mean it  their civility borders on insanity  but it is touching nevertheless  the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface  there are more than enough characters to love and to hate  and all of the casting is deadon  special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable  in titanic  for which he created a ninetenths scale model of the entire ship  cameron strove for accuracy at all costs  the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two  and the front section becomes vertical in the water  people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately  besides being romantic and dramatic  the script includes liberal doses of humor  from the many deliciously subtle verbal putdowns to the physical comedy  as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man  the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears    its goodbye for a little while   a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first    this boats for mommies and children  therell be a boat in a little while for daddies   basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats  it made the decks look too crowded otherwise  perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheims onboard the ship  in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink  he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew    no thanks   the elegantly attired guggenheim replies    were dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen  but we would like a brandy   titanic runs     it is rated pg for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up  ,1,1
151,stallone attempts to act in this cop drama  the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal  whos nephew  played by michael rappaport  is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths  keital dosent really want to get involved in anything  gets rid of rappaport  and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on  this film should be brilliant  it sounds like a great plot  the actors are first grade  and the supporting cast is good aswell  and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance  however  it cant hold up  although the acting is fantastic  even stallone isnt bad  the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long  with nothing really happening in them  in fact  the only scenes that do work are action scenes  which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid  in this film  serious means dull  the dialogue is warbling  and basically just repeats the same points over and over  no matter who is delivering them  the plot  which has potential  is wasted  again just being cliched after a while  in fact  the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro  both delivering their usual good performances  however  stallone  although not given much to say  gives a good performance  however  its not all that bad  as said above  the action scenes are well done  theres also a very good ending  which uses the cinemas sound system well  in fact  the last  minutes of this  hour film are one of the best endings of   if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending  cop land  then  turns out not to be a power house film  but a rather dull  and not every exciting film  hugely disappointing  and i cant really recommend it  ,0,0
152,contrary to popular belief  not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece  some of them arent even good  some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful  un indien dans la ville   presented as  little indian  big city   and remade into that crap tim allen flick   junglejungle    and this  what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick    french twist   the  cool  american title  not the real one  which was  gazon maudit   literally meaning  twisted ground   or something like that  deals with a married couple with kids  and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them  loli and alain chabat  victoria abril and alain chabat  are not exactly happily married  always on business trips  alain chabat more than once cheats on her  and she eventually finds out  and one day  she meets a butch mechanic  marijo  the cowriterdirector josiane balasko   and they two kinda hit it off  so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious  sleeping with marijo  but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo  but shes also realizes shes still in love with alain chabat  so  of course  she does the obvious from that  she decides to keep them both  shell be  and sleep  with each of them for  days each  then on sunday  shell rest by herself  after all  she needs it if shes gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel  the film goes on for over an hour and a half  through stupidity after stupidity  moronic twist after moronic twist  and soon theres the little ironic      ending  i know its a completely different culture  and im quite familiar with the french and their cinema  but this is just bad  none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in  fargo   a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point   and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience  whats shocking is this was not only one of frances biggest hits  but it was nominated for a lot of cesars  french equivalent of oscars   the writing and directing is really the big problem with it  josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role  but her little sex comedy isnt very humerous  entertaining  or even deep at all  even woody allens notverygood  a midsummer nights sex comedy  is intelligent  wellwritten  and possesses some depth  this is shallow  unfunny  and pretty annoying to watch  the film moves at the pace of a snail  and is damnnear painful to watch  thank god for the fast forward button  the acting  however  isnt bad at all  the actors do the best they can with the bad material  and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script  and the fact that shes stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids   and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband  but  french twist  is just pretty lame  its not overly horrible  and has a couple very  very  very brief moments  but its just a really crap film  and an example of an illadvised distribution of a foreign film  ,0,0
153,it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare  the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle  a jim carrey vehicle at that  and so it is  the truman show is the most perplexing  crazed  paranoid and ribtickling morality play ive seen since idontknowwhen  dont credit carrey  it starts with andrew niccol  gattaca   who created the script ten years ago  the story  replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones  is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience    ironically  it was within these past ten years that  realitybased  television have become a predominant fixture into our culture  who knew   oneupping niccol  it was when unlikely candidatedirector peter weir took the helm that things fell into place  weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone  deftly mixing capra with kafka  throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling  it was weirs first stroke of genius to create seahaven  a suburban paradiseprison that would make spielberg cower in shame  for example  bystanderextras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of dog fancy  the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to not leave the island  credit weir for his second stroke  the casting of carrey  carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn  on  and act goofy whenever the camera is near  not here  his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on  and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination  just as well  the academy rarely honors goofy comedians  excepting robin williams   he stretches enough to alter his hypersilly image considerably  playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carreys life  no pun intended  better in a smaller  more pivotal role is ed harris as christof  who mixes the right amount of his apollo   work the problem  people  character with dustin hoffmans megaglomaniac producer in wag the dog  and then only slightly svengalian  it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and trumans well being  yes  in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son  and has provided the best universe he could provide  he thinks  rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone  mrs  dalloway  as carreys true  forbidden love   sylvia  very effective in another pivotal small role  laura linney  congo  and noah emmerich  copland  have the unfortunate task of playing trumans wife and best friend  their sitcomish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development  the exception is at the very beginning  where they speak into the camera  wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman  and for society in general  there are other little problems with the script  are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years  was there any reason as to why in one scene  it rained solely on truman  even though it never had to  how is it they hire hundreds of extras  and none of them could drive a boat  and yet truman  fearful of water  is helming a sailboat effortlessly  and couldnt christof have turned off the wind  to strand truman at sea  these little contrivances  however  do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work  the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show  and we are drawn to trumans mundane existence for no other reason than it is there  the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut  upon leaving the theater  i was looking up in the sky  wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome  just checking  ,1,1

155,shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen  it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly  and and a half hours that it occupies  that is  however  not to say it is a good film  a quality production or anything of the sort  shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work  the finest sign of this may be the plot  in looking back  there seems to be little more than a thin  predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books  philip henslowe  geoffrey rush  owns  of the  theatres in london  it is at the peak of the royal theatre era  and queen elizabeth  the recently damed judi dench  by  appropriately enough  queen elizabeth ii  is very much a fan  however  to directly quote the film  he has  cash flow problems   through a long set of events  it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts  so  mr  henslowe employs the young playwright  william shakespeare  joseph fiennes  to pen a comedic production  however  the young writer has a severe case of writers block  and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well  he has the title in mind  romeo and ethel  the pirates daughter  even that joke loses steam after a while  but cant seem to put words to paper  then  as only hollywood could have it  through a long set of twisted events  he meets viola de lesseps  gwyneth paltrow  and falls madly in love  thus curing his writers block  there are many other little issues that mr  henslowe encounters  but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing  the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to its author  ironically  that couldnt be truer here  the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot  but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors  one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner  but rather  young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love  so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production  and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a characters name in the credits  the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeths theatres  joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though  he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad  gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well  however  the supporting cast does almost save the day  geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking  they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links  you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting  no  armageddon doesnt qualify as real acting    and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well  but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film  so it remains plagued by poor performances  when all is said and done  shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained  however  as the film so kindly pointed out  entertainment may be fun  but it isnt necessarily quality  and this certainly isnt quality  perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel  as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work  simply put  it is farfetched  poorly crafted  but very entertaining  ,0,0

160,like the wonderful  drama   awakenings   starring robin williams and robert de niro   at first sight   directed by irwin winkler  is inspired by a true story documented by physicfirst sight   directed by irwin winkler  is inspired by a true story documented by physician oliver sacks  since  awakenings  was so very good  and made my top ten list the year it was released   at first sight  is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall  but is still an intelligent and vibrantlyacted drama  the film begins as amy  mira sorvino   a stressedout new york architect  decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country  at the hotel she is staying at  she makes a massage appointment and after a long  soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions  she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil  val kilmer   only to find out later that he is actually blind  amy doesnt really care if he has a handicap or not  and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love  once she has returned to new york  amy begins to research on virgils certain type of retinal blindness  which he has had since three years of age  and out of a stroke of luck  comes into contact with a doctor  bruce davison  who believes he can repair virgils sight  even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history  at first reluctant  virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery  much to the hesitance of his overbearing  but loving older sister  kelly mcgillis   ultimately  the surgery is a success  but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees  since he has never visually seen anything before  only touched objects  he moves into amys apartment and she is eager to stand by him  but virgils maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship  on the basis of the overall story   at first sight  is indeed a film that has been done many times before  and owes a great deal to its predecessor   awakenings   what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance  however  what helps  at first sight  rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy  usually  romantic pictures are of the shameless puppydog sort  the recent tom hanksmeg ryanstarrer  youve got mail  immediately pops to mind   but with this film  i grew to care more about the characters and their plight  the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil  the massaging sequences were strangely erotic  maybe even more so than the later actual  love scenes   and as their romantic involvement quickly developed  the film was both entertaining and sweet  and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two  these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known  with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting  peaceful life in the country to amys eventful life in the  big city   the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board  val kilmer  usually cast in the  macho  type of role  was always believable as a blind person  and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears  it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity  but to sympathize with  and he pulled it off  mira sorvino  who made a spectacular debuting splash in s hilarious woody allen comedy   mighty aphrodite   for which she won a welldeserved oscar as a kindhearted  but ditzy hooker  is a standout here  although she has made some mediocre film choices since then  s  mimic   s  the replacement killers    she always has managed to come out unscathed  and it is with  at first sight  that she finally has another juicy role to play  in a truthful climactic scene set in amys apartment between she and virgil  sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today  and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces  kelly mcgillis  who could have easily come off as the  bad   onedimensional sister  instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother  finally  nathan lane  who is usually a little too overthetop  is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist  the one misstep of  at first sight  is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil  very little is ever said or discussed concerning it  and when the surgery occurs  it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes  perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more indepth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences  but i would personally take realism  even if it is graphic  any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder  in  awakenings   the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed  because of how strong the screenplay  written by steve levitt  is in the way it deals with the main relationship  and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino  the films few problems can be swept over to the side  the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is  no doubt  in respect to the reallife couple that the film was inspired by  who are still together after many years  even though the setting of the film was changed to new york   since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies   at first sight  comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace  ,1,1
161,  mandingo  has traditionally been seen as one of two things  either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south  or in the words of film critic leonard maltin   a trashy potboiler  that  appeals only to the sm crowd   actually  i think  mandingo  is a strange combination of the two  although it fails on both fronts  its too trashy to be good drama  but too dramatic to be good trash  the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell  james mason  and his son  hammond  perry king   one day in new orleans  hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede  heavyweight boxer ken norton   although the movie never explains it  a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  according to the movie  mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  meanwhile  hammond has married his cousin  blanche  susan george   because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  hammond  however  is happier spending nights with his  bed wench   the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  it is quickly apparent that hammond  despite his overt racism  is more in love with his bed wench  a sensitive slave girl named ellen  brenda sykes   than he is with blanche  hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  pleasured  her before he did  of course  its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls  but the fact that his wife  a  white lady   had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  so blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child  although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond   so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  and hammond poisons blanche  hammond then finds mede  shoots him twice in the shoulder  and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  yes  you read right  the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  judging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in th century southern society  when  mandingo  was released in   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  dramatically   mandingo  is weak and unfocused  and historically its mostly confused  if one were to judge history by this film  it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality  not economics  not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  except for a few house servants  the men spend most of the time sitting around  while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  but  mandingos  overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick  although theres plenty of violence  fights  vicious beatings  shootings  and the aforementioned human boiling sequence  thrown in for good measure   some tried to write off  mandingo  as a blaxploitation film  one of a number of quicklymade  lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  but its not that easy    mandingo  was studiofinanced by paramount pictures  and produced by dino de laurentiis  the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as  the bible      the remake of  king kong      and the illfated  dune      the director was richard fleischer  a veteran who was best known for several special effectsladen action movies including     leagues under the sea     and  fantastic voyage      as well as such superior suspense films as  the narrow margin      the script  based on the supermarket bestseller by ken ostott  and the subsequent play by jack kirkland   was penned by norman wexler  who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on  serpico   james mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt   and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  so why is  mandingo  so bad  a number of reasons  including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  it combines stereotyped slavetalk   yessuh  massuh    stereotyped southern white trash talk   fer whutre you gittin outta bed     and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk   if you see me hang  you gonna know you killed a black brother     fleischers direction is clumsy  especially during the fight scenes  and all the actors give weak performances  especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  nevertheless  credit should be given where credit is due  despite its exploitative nature   mandingo  was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  until then  there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  even classics such as  gone with the wind     can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter    mandingo  reassessed the south  and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations  green fields  and pretty sunsets  but all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview  it claims to see things from the black perspective  but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners  with a little more maturity and different handling   mandingo  might have been an effective  worthwhile film  while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery  it never deals with them  the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile  but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing  there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner  but  mandingo  never does it  steven spielberg touched on that same topic in  schindlers list      by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid  the difference between that film and  mandingo  is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair  unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma    mandingo  is satisfied to simply show some skin  and because of that  its  trashy potboiler  nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished  ,0,1

167,while alex browning  devon sawa  waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris  bad omens seem to surround him  as soon as he buckles into the plane  he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after takeoff  when the vision begins to come true  alex bolts for the door  dragging several students and a teacher in his wake  the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted  he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community  and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die  alex and another survivor  clear rivers  ali larter   investigate the suspicious  suicide  of a friend  and a mortician  tony  candyman  todd  clues them in to the truth  alex interrupted deaths design by saving people who should have died in the explosion  and death will want to claim its rightful victims  in order to save himself and the others  alex will have to figure out deaths new plan and thwart it  of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the  scream  audience   final destination  is the best so far  talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula  weve seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered onebyone by a faceless slasher  but reddick cuts out the hockeymasked middleman and makes the villain death itself  firsttime feature director james wong made the most of that premise  every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding  reminding us that death is everywhere  can come at anytime  everyday objects and events vibrate with menace  the most amusing harbinger of doom  john denvers  rocky mountain high   which is played several times in the movie before someone dies    the link is that denver died in a plane crash  and the song includes a line about fire in the sky   the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror  devon sawa  who previously starred in another horror flick   idle hands   gives a frantic and convincing lead performance  kerr smith is carter hogan  an antagonist of alexs whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane  smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence  seann william scott  whos also in theaters right now in  road trip   plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter  tony todds onescene cameo is delicious but all too brief  bottom line  watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between  but this destination is worth visiting  ,1,1
168,  a man is not a man without eight taels of gold   starring sammo hung  sylvia chang  directed by mabel cheung  written by cheung and alex law  cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love  neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful  but both are good enough  and along the way there is one perfect scene  which is one more than you find in most films  slim  played by portly sammo hung  better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies  is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york  when the movie opens  we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver  he does not seem particularly out of place  in fact  he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years  spending most of his life savings in the process  and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water  as he realizes that you can never go home  he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters  cheap sunglasses  and lobsters  which have to be large  to prove theyre american  the tokens of his success  he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch  because without eight taels of gold  a man is not a man  my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east  and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb   he loses most of this stuffexcept the goldwhen his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride  so to speak  on a raft along the river which runs past his parents village  when he arrives unannounced  he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father  all of this has the makings of a routine comedy  and the movie has its amusing moments  as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming  and they all give him birds  so by evenings end he is surrounded by turkeys  ducks  geese and other sundry fowl  but eight taels is not a comedyit is a sad  sweet story about the choices people make  and how they are sometimes irreparable  director mabel cheung  an autumns tale  the soong sisters  sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the worldwhat it is like to no longer have a place to call home  slim does not belong in china  nor does he belong in america  where he can barely speak the language  seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village  we come to know the world slim left behind  and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time  and wishes it felt more like home  the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed  i  being one  was sympathetic  on his way to his parents village  slim hooks up with jenny  sylvia chang   whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed oddsandends  which is what he continues to call her  although she is now a mature  professional  attractive woman  to be married in the spring to an americanchinese man  slim and oddsandends fall for each other  thats predictable  the manner in which their  non  romance is played out is not  the emotions involved are adult and complex  and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma  its typical  for instance  that the fianc  in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk  because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover  but here the fianc  is a decent  ordinary guy  and although slim would like to feel anger  he cannot  the fianc  has done nothing wrong  the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions  take your pick  eight taels has its share of flaws  the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak   but it compensates with insight  when oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco  she notes resignedly   its all the same  wherever we go  well be in chinatown   and her straightforward statement expresses much  there is insight  too  in the understanding of the consequences of slim and oddsandends decisions  he to move to america  she to marry a chineseamerican  both their choices were perhaps born of impatience  perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greenerand it turns out that both choices were wrong  but they cannot undo them  they must live with what they have done  such is life  the movie is tender toward these people  but it offers no false comforts  everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene  which is the culmination of the love story  slim and oddsandends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly  with the muted poppop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them  and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss  the exchange that follows  and what slim then does  is poignant and perfect  with clarity and understatement  we see two peoples lives  their heartbreaks and virtues  summed up in a single moment  yes  the film is flawed  but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies  ,1,1
169,  virus  is a monster movie without a monster  any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise  sadly   virus  does not deliver  on any level  the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something  we never find out what  to a big boat with lots of satellites on it  sudddenly  a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space  and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat  cut to seven days later  we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures  see  they spend all their time sailing around looking for deadinthewater ships to rescue  and then collect the reward money  at least  i  think  thats what they do  along with many other things in the film  their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isnt really explained  so  they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it  and decide to haul it back to russian waters  the only problem is  the crew starts disappearing onebyone and turning into borg  yes  borg  complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye  apparently  this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical  so  it creates makeshift machines and uses humans for  spare parts   blah  blah  blah  i could go on forever describing the ludicrous socalled plot  but i wont  suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man     everything else in this movie has been taken from other  better  movies  for example  many of the machines resemble those found in the littleseen japanese movie   tetsuothe iron man   and the plot is right out of  aliens   the funny thing is  i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie  i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies  like last years underappreciated  deep rising   but  virus   as i mentioned earlier  doesnt even have a monster  it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption    virus  is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it  besides the lame  monster   its chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say  and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into  for example  there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to  negotiate  with the alien  now  i dont know about you  but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated  i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it  that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life  finally   virus  isnt scary  the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary  as it is  its about as frightening as a box of cookies  skip  virus   if its a cool monster movie you want  rent the far superior  and the granddaddy of this genre   aliens   ,0,0
170,  you cant have any of this  its all mine    a twisted priest  charles huevelman  hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana  angela zimmerly  looks on uninterested  an evil presence  appropriately named the presence  dj vivona   rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him  for kicks  the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered  when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes  the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped  they enlist the help of alison  ramona midgett   a recent suicide victim  to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the netherrealm  her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was  an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed  the kings sorcerer  amblyn  who also lost his job   decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice  during the downtime in his unemployment  amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery  evil  and torture ruled  abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm  so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love  in this new realm  amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm  after each murder  abraham would become stronger  until his power surpassed that of amblyns  because of the screwup that allowed the recent escape  abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself  as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways  the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered  if theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film  its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty  films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this  and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  this film is essentially an  minute stalkandslash film  following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street  through   intercut with almost  minutes of strange and  supposedly  haunting images  many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  if there arent bizarre images floating past the screen  then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone  compelling  but ultimately not  the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images  the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence  when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv had found its way to my tv  at least the music in the film is pretty decent  made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett  at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them  and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing   for some reason though  he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance  one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel  then theres an inbred father  dwight spurgin  and his two inbred children  mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace  that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun  and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of  rednecks  when you yourself had all of these cool powers  and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time  i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment  the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence  the character in question  dana  angela zimmely   has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated  a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken  he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken  taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever  when she starts to leave  the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life  walks out  and makes like it wants to be crucified by her  the presence starts to clap annoyingly  which continues for the rest of the sequence  until dana takes off with the strange creature following her  when it finally catches up to her  she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ  the box for the film claims  because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture  parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of   contains nudity and graphic violence   while both is certainly true  there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts  besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump  a semigraphic selfsurgery scene  and two instances of head trauma  one run over and one melting   most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety  as for nudity  it is very sparse  but at least we get to see angela zimmerly  far and away the most attractive cast member  before her body is bruised  torn  and bloodied by the dragging incident  ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www  bmovie  com  it has been presented in in fullframe only and the transfer  for a film shot a good deal in mm  is pretty decent  besides the decent soundtrack  which is also available from www  bmovie  com   a makingof video is also available called on thin ice  i havent had the opportunity to see the documentary  but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed  if only to see how director eric stanze  director of a similar cult film called savage harvest   conducted the atmosphere on set  ,0,0
171,a few months before the release of star wars episode   the phantom menace  th century fox decides to release another space film  that is a complete rip off of star wars  what is the point of this  i do not know  but i wish it hadnt been done  considering wing commander is definitely the years worst film so far  to attract people to this horrible movie  they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace  wing commander will draw large crowds  because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time  the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight  many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game  i found this very interesting  considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie  it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though  freddie prinze jr  stars in the film as christopher blair  wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie  this was definitely his worst performance to date  after januarys shes all that  i actually saw a good actor in freddie  but now all those visions have been crushed    for now anyway   christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi  a group that is trying to destroy the earth  blairs parents also fought in the space battles  and also died there  his parents were pilgrims  so many people disrespect him because of this  blair is under the command of  angel   played by saffron burrows  and he is friends with another pilot  todd  maniac marshall   played by matthew lillard  matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie  and he does in this one too  his character as stu in s scream  a   was a great one  but now  it seems like that same role is being played again  only in a space movie  the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth  this plot is very flimsy  and doesnt give a whole lot to work with at all  this explains why wing commander drags on  seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on  the acting is horrible in wing commander  many lines seem out of place  and are completely meaningless  the acting and dialogue was so terrible  i even found myself laughing at it  the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music  the special effects are very unrealistic  when looking at two ships flying side by side  it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them  the explosions look very unrealistic as well  a ship will be blown up  but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second  this is very unrealistic  music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time  the music also felt like video game music  and it was very corny and annoying sounding  after we are given the plot  the film repeats itself for another hour  without any plot twists  interesting scenes  or anything important to the film  blair is forced to make jumps over other planets  and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft  for the entire length of the movie  it takes place in space  it is truly like you are in a video game  because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long  extended period of time  its not much fun to watch at all  if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships  i would go watch star wars at home  at least star wars pays attention to people  myth  feelings  and has some real plot to it  the bottom line bring on the phantom menace th century fox  ,0,0
172,imagine this scenario  you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long  excruciating crosscountry car trips  far from the city and into the deserted rural routes  so far  the trip is idyllic when  abruptly  your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere  it is not an easy situation  but a perfectly plausible one  the panorama in which breakdown musters its throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness  it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays  but breakdown doesnt bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful  titillating climax that by its finale  engrosses a viewer with total absorption  the plot is somewhat reminiscent of s the vanishing  kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor  a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job  when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest  jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver  who later  will be an important player in the plot department  minutes later after that  their brand new  strikingly red  jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops  jeff cannot detect the cars problem  so he allows amy to take a ride with red  j  t walsh   a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town  where jeff will meet her at a local diner  it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudosuspenser  but instead it opts for maximum fervor  jeff manages to restart the car himself  but when he arrives at the diner  she is nowhere in sight  disconcerted  the coffee shops bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife  a town about twenty miles from here  there  trouble arises  and i shall not reveal anything else  since that would be spoiling the fun of whats head  there are many involving  tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck  will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam  it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil  and rooting for the good guys  in this case jeff  kurt russell is one of the few topnotch hollywood actors which doesnt overblow his acting  and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses  so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letterperfect  suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation  from a jolly man  to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one  not many wellpaid actors can deliver these type of performances  but russell is one of them  as an everyday man  he pulls it off extremely convincingly  what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality  which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films  minutes  although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences  very well done  yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with  faced with an enigma about his wifes whereabouts  the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters  including the cryptic villains  who in essence  make the movie what it is  whats most impressive however  is the feature debut by writerdirector jonathan mostow  mostow  hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle  alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot  efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nailbiting suspense sought for in a well made affair  contrary to most american thrillers  he doesnt rely on visual flair  but on aesthetics and substance  after breakdown  he should gain vast notoriety  the villains in the movie arent your routine outofthisworld idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective  the baddies in breakdown  all well acted  are normal  seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer  conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder  the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks  and  of all things in the world  it is becoming rather easy to root for villains  jon voight in anaconda  in todays movies  worth a special mentioning is j  t walsh  who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision  as the leader of the gang  he renders a deliciously wicked performance  temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for  alfred hitchcock used suspenseand action not only to stimulate  but as a way of aiding his audiences fascination in his stories  which were slowly realizing mans biggest fears  breakdown yields exactly that  it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man  acting like an ordinary man  looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero  despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock  i think  would approve of breakdown        ,1,1
173,there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director  of course  his best film was s masterpiece   halloween   but he also made s  the fog   and s underrated   prince of darkness   heck  he even made a good film in   with  in the mouth of madness   but something terribly wrong happened to him in   with the terrible comedy   memoirs of an invisible man   somehow  carpenter has lost his touch  with junk like his failed  remake of   village of the damned   to his uninspired  sequel   escape from l  a   those movies  however  look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film   john carpenters vampires   if i was him  i definately wouldnt want to put my own name in the title  it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as   vampires   the story is simple  jack crow  james woods  is a vampire hunter who  along with one of his partners  montoya  daniel baldwin   and a prostitute  katrina  sheryl lee   survives an attack from the master vampire  valek  thomas ian griffith   since katrina was previously bitten by him  crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later  and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her  it seems valeks mission is to steal a black  wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him  my question is  how many time have we seen this same story played out  well  the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made    john carpenters vampires   sadly enough  is one of the most unscary horror films ive ever seen  in fact  there isnt even one suspenseful moment in the whole minute running time  the nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed  without any interesting camera work  which is usually a trademark of carpenters  and then we come to the screenplay  which  as far as i can tell  is nearly nonexistent  there is no story development  and there isnt even an attempt to flesh out the characters  james woods can be a good actor  but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of  pseudo  clever lines of dialogue  daniel baldwin has some potential  but his character comes off as being very dense  and sheryl lee  faring much better as laura palmer in  twin peaks    like all of the female characters  plays an offensive stereotypical whore  there is not an ounce of intelligence  or excitement in   john carpenters vamires   which is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters  he has said that he turned down directing   halloween  h   because he couldnt work up any excitement for it  and yet  when asked about a  vampires  sequel  he said he would be happy to do it  i think thats a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent  not to mention a significant number of iq points  ,0,0
174,synopsis  wealthy cuban landowner luis  banderas  gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride  not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia  jolie   she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit  soon  julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart  and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld  luis begins to realise that  for him  there is no turning back  review  given the absurdism of its wouldbe plot  its unlikely that  original sin  could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking  regardless of writer  director or stars  this is  at its heart  bmovie junk  a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions  that said   original sin  could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it  instead  cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production  and directs it as such  the result is a vapid  uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses  as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill  consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie  brightlylit and mostly filmed from above  it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show  cristofer doesnt even manage to capture the allure of cuba  instead of portraying his setting as a steamy  sensuous island paradise  it appears bland and lifeless  at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest  there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script  but arent being given the chance  the same cannot be said of jane  whose billy is nebbish and transparent  also unwise is the jolie framing sequence  which practically gives away the films denouement  ,0,0
175,youve got to love disney  no matter what they serve up  it is a guaranteed success as long as its animated  kids have to go see the movie  then they have to get the toys  oh  the video came out  got to buy it  or risk little billys temper tantrums for the next month  all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca  a visit to the magic kingdom  stay at the disneyland hotel  buy a disney tshirt  eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick  its both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it  dale carnegie should have had it so good  whats most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality  you see  disney animated features these days have two components  theme and plot  the theme changes with each new movie  the plot does not  the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped  and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features  they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same  however  while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as boxoffice receipts  merchandising dollars  and glimmers in the eyes of little children  critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer  luckily  disneys latest animated offering  mulan  manages to be engaging and refreshing  even while rife with formula  the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns  led by the imposing shanyu  miguel ferrer   soon  chinas emperor  pat morita  mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in chinas defense  when the fa family is served notice  it is the elderly father  fa zhou  soontek oh  who must answer the call  as there are no other males in the household  fearing her father will surely be killed in battle  fa mulan  mingna wen  disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army  mulan  based on a chinese epic poem  is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling  mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family  as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional womans role  and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband  we see that  grace  is not one of her strong points  very early on  we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to ones family  and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker  mulan fails at that task  by leaving home to fight in her fathers place  she may not only spare his life  but bring honor  too  as is the case with most disney musicals  the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film  im not sure if they will get much airplay  but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time  both lea salonga  who provides the singing voice for mulan  and donny osmond who sings for shang  the captain of mulans army unit and obligatory love interest  are more than competent  although salongas voice translates much better to animation  you have to hear it to understand  interestingly  the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan  there is no significantly big number  which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film  but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie  it is  however  an expectation which has been built by disneys own formulaic history  and some viewers may feel as if something is missing  artistically  the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork  and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works  it helps to contribute a more authentic  and therefore more credible  nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically  disneyfied  ethnic tale  there are also a couple of visually standout scenes  one involving the charge of shanyus hun army  which utilizes the same computerenhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast  the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it  when mulan resolves to take her fathers place  she dons her fathers old battle armor  and unsheathes a sword  as she does so  you can see her reflection in the polished metal  it just left me thinking   that was really cool   a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film  varying from the straight  such as soontek oh as fa zhou  to the comical  such as harvey fierstein as yao  a gruff  pugilistic member of shangs conscripted army  even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu  the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan  although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin  murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance  i found the choice of b  d  wong as shang a little strange  you may remember him as martin shorts wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride   but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast  so i guess anythings possible  in any event  wong performs admirably as well  one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa  she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie  but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people  june foray  who supplies grandmother fas speaking voice  is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale  as in boris and natasha   marni nixon  who provides grandmother fas singing voice  is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i  maria in west side story  and eliza in my fair lady  with this in mind  hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history  mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films  in an effort to be culturally sensitive  and to avoid a  miss saigon  type debacle   disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asianamerican actors for both lead and supporting roles  in addition to the actors already mentioned  the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong  gedde watanabe  james shigeta  and george takei  i guess clyde kusatsu wasnt available  at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half  mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and  happily  adults  this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next  rather than hope that the next one is better  ,1,1
176,    its certainly more than just a monster story     kenneth branagh  directoractorcowriter of mary shelleys frankenstein  kenneth branaghs new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankensteinfilms made throughout the years in almost every part of the world  including the most controversial version of them all  directed by james whale  the dark and stormy nights  the lightning bolts  the charnel houses of spare body parts  the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful  but the center of the film  quieter and more thoughtful  contains the real story  horrorfans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues  morality  philosophy and human elements of the story  and not on old fashioned horror cliches  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean  the year is   a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs  as the ice closes around his ship  a figure appears on the horizon  its a man  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew  his name is victor frankenstein  kenneth branagh  and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown  the myserious stranger begins his tale  or more precisely his confession  in geneva    he is remembering his childhood and youth  laughter  banquets and parties  a happy life  without troubles or concerns  here victor lived with his father  ian holm   mother  cherie lunghi   his surrogate sister  helena boham carter  and his servants in happiness and harmony  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed  like thunder from a quite sky  his mother dies  giving birth to his youngest brother  shocked  baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair  victor  already interested in science  becomes obsessed with death  standing on his mothers grave he says   oh mother   you did not have to die    no one should ever die    i will stop this   i promiss    after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished  victor travels to ingolstadt  in presuite of a medical career  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night  creating life from death  composing dead bodies  frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man  both physically and mentally  with strong electrical impulses  he managed to breeth life into his creation  the result was ugliness  realizing what he has done  frankenstein tried to undo his work  but it was to late  the creature has escaped  because of the epidemic  frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home  making plans for the wedding  for a while everything is as it was before his mothers death  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously    whales picture  although powerful  never managed to capture the total depth of the novel  brannagh has more or less done that  another thing is characters and actors  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast  the greatest performances comes from de niro  the monster  that has been played by  among others  charles ogle  karloff  lon chaney  bela lugosi  glenn strange  christopher lee  fred gwynne  as herman munster   and now  robert de niro  alone  hated and feared  he is completely aware of his ugliness  at first he is like a helpless  abandoned child  desperately reaching out for love  later when he reads frankensteins journal  and learns that he is composed of dead bodies  his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge  he is capable of killing without regret    i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground     and then i slowly crushed his neck    and as i killed him  i saw your face    that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator  and yet  he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable   for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all   rarely has a cinematic interpretation of  the daemon  approached the level of threedimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster  god knows why   with the power of an electrical storm  almost no time was granted on his charecter  who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel  here  branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein  establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death  sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment  and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character  on the outside he is strong  ambitious and talented scientist  but deep down he is unsecure  fragile and vaulerble  constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankensteins surrogate sister  who at the end becomes his wife for a little while  before death drives them apart  the rest of the cast  playing secondary characters  is solid and nothing less than convincing  visually the film is stunning  especially the makeup   the spinning camera  the constantly buildingup musical acore  the art direction  the production design  the costumes are all magnificent  from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests  to the plagueriddled streets of ingolstadt  mary shelleys frankenstein is a wonder to behold  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare     all i once loved lies in a shallow grave     by my hand     and the film ends exacly as hamlet  when the creature sets both his and his creators body on fire  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness  and a terrifying last closeup on the creatures smiling face  can a man create life  then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him  to whom are its actions then attributable  the creature or the being who brought about its existence  shelley did not answer these questions  but she certainly posed them  following her example  branagh does the same  his film is a tragic saga about playing god  victor frankenstein is not an evil man  he wanted to change the world to the better  in this he represents everything science stands for  acting without doubts  never considering the consequences of his actions  produced by francis ford coppola  frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film  dracula   in comparison  i can say that  dracula  has visuals that even  frankenstein  can not live up to  but when it comes to story  characters and casting   frankenstein  is stronger  but stronger than both of them  on every aspect  is neil jordans  interview with the vampire   although the film is not perfect  the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective   these minor faults are easily forgivable  as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating  branagh has probably created one of the best  if not the best  adaptions of shellys classic novel

177,  ladybugs  is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees  the pathetic team who beats the champs  cross dressing  and the presence of rodney dangerfield  this picture doesnt play like a comedy for children  so who is it aimed at  and why is it told like a minute sitcom instead of a feature film  rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee  a total schmuck working at a huge corporation  he obviously doesnt have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead  which he does by volunteering to coach the companys girls soccer team  what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie  jackee  know absolutely nothing about the game  and the players seem to know even less  i didnt laugh  but for some reason it didnt annoy me that much  chesters fiancee bess  graff  thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position  and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams  jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew  who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester  probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team  what original story ideas    what we get is just another retread of the  underdog sports team  mixed with some cross dressing  unfortunately  the film isnt smart enough to play upon the drag aspect  in fact  it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable  could it be any more obvious martha is a boy  he only wears a girls wig  without any makeup  and they dont even give him falsies  brandis doesnt bother to mimic a girls voice either  then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress  but for what reason  martha is only seen on the soccer field  why would they buy a dress for her  just when we think the martha character is going to be useful  she disappears  and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on  when bess discovers whats really going on she breaks up with chester  and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss  this film couldve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy  but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary  and bad at that   theres just too much of a sitcom feel here  especially during the socalled serious moments  and all the confusion between the characters  ive seen worse movies than  ladybugs   but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm  so even when it turns sour it doesnt seem as bad as it is  dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end  but at what a price  ,0,0
178,the catch phrase for disneys rocket man is one spoken by fred z  randall  harland williams   the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes    it wasnt me   he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is  williams cant take all the blame  but he sure cant justify himself with his own simple tag line either  fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy  turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wideeyed at a poster of the earth  as a yearold  fred hasnt grown up much  but at least hes somewhat closer to his goal  now designing astronaut software for nasa  when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured  nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void      fred  yes  although hes an obviously klutzy moron  nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program  and time itself  has ever known  for the first part of the film  we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park  he laughs  he screams  but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than childs play  his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats  much to the dismay of cocky counterpart  mission commander captain overbeck  william sadler   who once held the records  overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet  one being astronaut julie ford  the stupids jessica lundy   and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist  from here on out  we are subjected to one lame gag after another  dealing with snot  laxatives  and flatulence  you know  standard kid movie material  almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist  williams is awful in his first starring role  we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and peewee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring  williams would be it  while hes not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany  stupid comedy  hes just as unlikeable  to say it more understandably  jim carrey might annoy you more  but this guy is even less funny  why  because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role  his performance is too understated and boring  classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy  stan laurel  for example  was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him  peter sellers  as inspector clouseau  was so selfassured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip  it was humor at its best  williams  on the other hand  cant garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his antiglory  as for the rest of the cast  including some bigger names in smaller roles  beau bridges and shelley duvall   nobody is worth watching whatsoever  this is just another example of the fastfood equivalent of cinema  massproduced  less than mediocre  over priced  and hard to stomach  giving it oneandahalf stars is  extremely  generous  but even ill admit to laughing a few times  the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids  laughter was something rarely heard  even from the children  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didnt crack up over every little thing  then again  maybe they were asleep  some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies  claiming adults arent the targeted audience and therefore arent meant to  and wont  enjoy them  sadly  its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right  a twohour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there  but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast  which could easily do the same thing  and saying that a parents perspective isnt important is quite a poor theory to have when theyre the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place  ,0,1

181,steve martin is one of the funniest men alive  if you can take that as a true statement  then your disappointment at this film will equal mine  martin can be hilarious  creating some of the best laughoutloud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters  you wont find any of them here  the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit  bilko  and the name isnt an accident  is the head of an army motor pool group  but his passion is his schemes  every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hairbrained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base    mchales navy  s granddaddy  thats the idea behind this movie too  but the difference is that  as farfetched and usually goofy as the television series was  it was funny  there is not one laugh in the film  the remake retains the goofiness  but not the entertainment  everything is just too clean  it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it  it all looks brand new  even the old beatup stuff  martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role  in the original  phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness  martins bilko is a pale imitation  the only semibright spot is phil hartman as bilkos archenemy  its not saying much  considering martins lackluster character  but hartman leaves him in the dust  ,0,1
182,recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep  he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour  then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food  then he took down a volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover  never really paying attention to the words or plot  and then  as a climax  he took out his video camera and pressed the  on  button  the result  william shakespeares romeo  juliet  the worst film ever made and a complete failure  though  to be fair  an interesting complete failure  the idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds  this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we cant see what is going on  and filming the dialogue in voice over  and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model  and making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom  and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion  i mean  man  this is the s  dude  however ive seen terrible films that are fun to watch    examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau    that rule doesnt apply here  this is a film that takes itself seriously  that is its major fault  another problem was pointed out by my friend  alex  who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout     the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides  here its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo    just look at the way they film him    from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work  and dicaprios awful performance doesnt help  luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us  the result is a mess  you can feel him striving to be something he isnt  he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles  he tries very hard  key word  tries    oh look  hes filming above water action from below  pretty  what does it represent   why do people do ugly things  i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face  ,0,0
183,tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently  the dalai lama has made speaking tours  tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops  the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months    kundun    presence   a name the monks call the young dalai lama  opens in  with the search for the th incarnation of the tibetan leader  a group of monks enters a village and a twoyearold child catches their attention  the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as  mine   he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country  he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in   the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results  eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india  comparisons to  seven years in tibet  are inevitable  both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt    kundun  features only native actors and is more of an insiders story  in some ways  this makes this film a superior concept  but it lacks the movement and spark that made  seven years  such an audiencepleaser  the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie  filmed in morocco for obvious reasons   the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computergenerated character  on an intellectual level  it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts  some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life isnt even mentioned here  glossed over in  seven years   the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses  we were just about to change things  after the chinese attack  the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins  his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail  especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain  the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience  walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience  martin scorsese  known for his dark tales of the underworld   goodfellas    taxi driver    casino   has shifted gears  something of a thematic followup to his  the last temptation of christ   this is his slowest film yet  oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese  most of these events take place offscreen  his decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable  the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations  philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting  i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again  hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india  i was struck by what was missing in the movie  as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is  there is a distance between the audience and the movie  the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings  with the exception of a few scenes  involvement with the characters is slight  one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama  shown as a mischievous boy who cant resist being a kid sometimes  an encounter with his older brother thubten j  norbu  a retired indiana university professor  who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment  but there arent many of these  even with its problems  the  kundun  experience is phenomenal  but one that i fear most will miss  many people who saw  seven years in tibet  will have a  been there  done that  attitude  its likely that the film will miss a widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping  ,1,1
184,anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia  wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes  deep  vibrant colors and an epic storyline  its true beauty comes from its subtle ruminations on the politics of power  whether its between governments  or the interplay between a man and a woman  anna  jodie foster  is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband  with son in tow  she takes the employ of king mongkut  chow yunfat  to tutor his son in the english language  mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his countrys future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world  anna function is to help provide that link  the core of the film  of course  deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate  foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wideeyed wonder  she is assertive  yet  respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him  it is one of fosters strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career  she brings a mature self awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster  its a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkuts monarchy  when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet midfilm  she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance  chowyun fats king mongkut is every measure of fosters anna  perhaps even more so  this is the chow yunfat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years  he is imposing  yet vulnerable  playful  but stern  it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance  precious time is stolen from the movies  minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the kings concubines  bai ling  and her love of a commoner  it strikes with the subtlety of siams fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story  some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie  although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film  it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma  a country backed by the british  anna and the king transcends being a predictable  traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness  it shows a seduction of intelligence  ever mindful of each others positions  anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs  conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying  if not achingly bittersweet  ,1,1
185,vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element  substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject  but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents  and  unlike any of the more outlandish myths  the vampire holds some realworld probability  one study claims    bloodsuckers exist worldwide  and places  in los angeles   but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys  john carpenter would like to remind us that they are  and always have been  a truly frightening element of the thriller genre  and remind us he does in his latest film  vampires  there was some question  as halloween weekend approached  of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinemas immensely successful blade  released in august  the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue  and dont even agree on some basic points of the slaying method    for instance  blades main weapons are silver and garlic  whereas main character jack crows technique is a wooden stake to the heart   blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization  while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate  both have their advantages  and here  carpenters style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered  when its all said and done  though  the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish  the level for gore is indeed set to maximum  this time  our hero is vaticansponsored slayer jack crow  james woods   hes a cynical  battleworn veteran  and the best of his bunch  he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest  and after exterminating a nest one night  they run up against a supervampire  termed a  master   named valek  thomas ian griffith   valek kills all of jacks team except for his partner  tony montoya  daniel baldwin   and as the two regroup  they learn that valek is the original vampire  now over six hundred years old  apparently  valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime  so with the aid of a priest named adam  tim guinee  and a bitten hooker  sheryl lee  as bait  they track valek down for the final confrontation  the script for vampires  written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel  is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year  crow  in particular  is a fun source of oneliners  and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism  baldwin  lee  and guinee are all fine supports  adding to the character pool  but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffiths bad guy  griffiths intense expression is perfect for the role  and the only downside is that hes got to talk sometime  luckily  hes got few lines  and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance  all said  fans will surely be impressed by this picture  and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one  certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters  ,1,1
186,note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction  the cinematic output from its creator  quentin tarantino  has been surprisingly low  oh  hes been busy  doing the talk show circuit  taking small roles in various films  overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn  making cameo appearances on television shows  providing a vignette for the illfated anthology four rooms  everything  it seems  except direct another featurelength film  its been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr  tarantinos new feature film  jackie brown  one of the most anticipated films of the year  and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the s  things arent going well for jackie brown  pam grier   shes  years old  stuck at a deadend job      a year  plus retirement benefits that arent worth a damn   as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america  and shes just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette  portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton  and police officer mark dargus  michael bowen  smuggling   from mexico for gunrunner ordell robbie  samuel l  jackson   who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry  robert forster   the loquacious ordell  based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny  bonghitting surfer girl melanie  bridget fonda  and agreeable crony louis gara  robert de niro  hang out  operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat  and hes soon out to silence jackie brown  meanwhile  the authorities target is ordell  and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a halfmillion dollars  only through a series of clever twists  turns  and doublecrosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses  although jackie brown marks mr  tarantinos first produced screenplay adaptation  based on the elmore leonard novel  rum punch    theres no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film  while hes adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense  the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead characters now black  in terms of ambiance  the film harkens back to the s  from the walltowall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets  even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage s productions  the opening sequence featuring ms  grier wordlessly striding through the lax  funky music blaring away on the speakers  is emblematic of films of that era  the timeframe for the film is in fact   but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro  of course  nothing in the film screams s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max  when they kiss  its perhaps the most tender scene of the year  tenderness  in a quentin tarantino film  sure  thereve been moments of sweetness in his prior films  the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer  or even in reservoir dogs  where a deep  unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters  but for the most part  mr  tarantinos films are typified by manic energy  unexpected outbursts of violence  and clever  often wordy  banter  these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown  but whats new here is a different facet of his storytelling  a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent  and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation  this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr  tarantino as simply a helmer of slick  hip crime dramas with fasttalking lowlifes  and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent  hes the real deal  this new aspect of mr  tarantinos storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character  that of the worldweary  sensitive  and exceedinglyprofessional max cherry  whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching  mr  forsters nuanced  understated performance is the best in the film  he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie  we smile along with him  much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitationera icon pam grier in the lead  with the wags buzzing that mr  tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travoltas thensagging career  as it turns out  ms  grier is solid in the films title role  although nothing here forces her to test her range  i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection  though  shes been working steadily over the years  often in directtovideo action flicks  but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burtons mars attacks  and larry cohens original gangstas  where she first teamed up with mr  forster   of course  its true that her role here was a godsend  a meaty a part as this is rarity for  any  actress  let alone one of her age and current status in the industry  while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone  it marks tremendous growth of mr  tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding  and whose characterizations have never been better  and while the films narrative doesnt really warrant a running time of  minutes  its filled with such sumptuous riches  ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining  inconsequential conversations

188,it was a crazy time in france  what with the french revolution right around the corner  king louis xv would soon die  and his son would become king louis xvi  such is the setting for beaumarchais  the scoundrel about the controversial playwright  spy and playboy pierreaugustin caron de beaumarchais  beaumarchais was the author of the plays   the barber of seville  and  the marriage of figaro   today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas  but  back in  when the movie takes place  they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once  the movie beaumarchais  the scoundrel takes a lighthearted approach to its subject  resulting in an inviting motion picture  one of frances most expensive productions ever  the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year  now in theatrical release in the united states  it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story  the secret of the films success  other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzacs costumes  has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais  with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile  he mesmerizes the camera and the audience  his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning  in a land where court intrigue determines ones destiny  constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy  as our story starts  we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship  into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight  beaumarchais  who has been having an affair with the mans wife  makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided  that over with  the fight is on  with luchinis charisma  it is hard to root for anyone other than him  audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert  in which he played the attorney  although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin  played by manuel blanc  he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style  michael epps warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jeanmarc kerdelhues lush but realistic looking sets  jeanclaude petits music  especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos  make for an enchanting time at the movies  director jeanclaude brisville  who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro  fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which  according to the press notes  was just a series of historic vignettes  the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie  but the actors smooth it over with their goodhearted style  typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water  taking his bath  one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man  another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution  all of this may sound like a dull historical drama  but it is anything but  the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts  the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marietherese  the real love of beaumarchaiss life  but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him  still  with his beguiling smile  one can never quite be sure if you should trust him  the movie  on the other hand  can be trusted to deliver a high old time  beaumarchais  the scoundrel runs     it is in french with english subtitles  the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex  and should be fine for most teenagers  ,1,1

190,my first press screening of  and already ive gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list  what an auspicious beginning  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l  a  and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere  firestorm  the directorial debut of dances with wolvess academy award winning cinematographer dean semler  is the first of the new years crop of movies  as our story opens  the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only  are  smokejumpers   we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl  where one of the gungho guys is taking a romance quiz from  cosmopolitan   having the time of their lives  they then jump into the middle of a burning forest  when  even in the beginning  the director cant get the small parts right  you can sense the movie is in trouble  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasolinefilled cars  smokejumper monica  christianne hirt  tells them to get away from their soontoexplode vehicles  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them  she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people  miraculously  they manage to hear her and move away  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots  the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building  as it does throughout  overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f  windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girls face  our shows two heroes  the crews chief  wynt perkins  played laconically by scott glenn  and his secondincommand  jesse graves  played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal  enter the burning house looking for the little girl  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse  this mawkish show cuts back to monica  who has a lifeordeath decision to make  the chopper with the fireretardant chemicals has only enough to save one group  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monicas two firefighting buddies  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved  yes  she goes for the majority  but  miracle of miracles  the other three come out alive anyway  not content with a traditional firefighting story  chris soths screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape     hoods in the woods   is what the  groundpounders  yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire   along the way  shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis  who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father  who was a marine drill instructor  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside  using a ramp  he shoots straight out of the top of the buildings attic  and when he hits the ground  he just rides off in a cloud of dust  when the film isnt using some stock footage of actual forest fires  the simulated ones look hokey  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions  the ending  with its sick twists  manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby   its not as bad as some of the television sitcoms   firestorm runs mercifully just     it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers  ,0,0
191,another independent film  this comedy  which was brought by miramax for  million  is good fun  favreau and vaughn  the lost world  jurassic park    play mike and trent  two everyday somethings on the lookout for women  the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve  and along the way we get to meet some of their friends  see their attempts at chatting up girls  and just basically get a insight into their lives  and all of this is great fun  swingers doesnt rely on huge special effects  or big name stars to provide entertainment  no  it just has a great script and superb little known actors  the script  by favreau  is great  mike is always missing is girlfriend  who hasnt called him for six months  and every time he meets a girl  he always end up telling her about the ex  the audience feels for this pathetic little man  thanks to the great script  vaughn is the money  swingers speak for the best  as the womanizing trent  always on the lookout for a new girl  some of his chatup lines are awful  but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his hard man nature  vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film  towards the end in a diner  the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great  but it never quite reaches tarantino standards  which i suspect the film was trying to reach   there are some excellent  laugh out loud jokes in the film  and some superbly funny set pieces  such as favreau cringeworhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence  embarrassing to him  hilarious to the audience   mike  trents friends are also good  although there characters seem a bit underwritten  and we never really learn as much as we would like about them  although this is primarily mike and trents film  it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends  they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background  but again  the lines they say are usually pretty good  and they do have some funny parts  its just a shame that they didnt have more meatier roles  the acting is superb  as said above  vaughn is superb as trent  hes definitely the best thing in the film  favreau is also good  acting as the little man very well  and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny  graham  boogie nights    has a small but good role as lorraine  a girl mike finally falls in love with  she hardly features in the film at all  but she still manages to make an impact on the audience  swingers  then  is funny  but it does have some flaws  firstly  the running time is a bit too short  the film comes to an abrupt halt  and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer  it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion  which is a shame  as most films are too long  also  this type of film has been done too many times  such as sleep with me     but these small flaws dont really spoil what is a funny  entertaining comedy  ,1,1
192,weighed down by tired plot lines and spielbergs reliance on formulas  saving private ryan is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches  there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics  spielbergs greatest strength as a director is the polished  formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story  but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war  or the holocaust  this technique backfires  for it creates coherent  comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size  complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken  in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films  saving private ryan tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a  pr mission  to pull a young man  ryan  whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere  out of combat on the normandy front just after dday  ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers  the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france  theres no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie  the equipment  uniforms and weapons are superbly done  the opening sequence  in which captain miller  tom hanks  leads his men onto omaha beach  is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat  another pleasing aspect of the film is spielbergs brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences  such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers  the banality of death in combat  the routine foulups in the execution of the war  and the cynicism of the troops  the technical side of the film is peerless  as always  the camera work is magnificent  the pacing perfect  the sets convincing  the directing without flaw  hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance  which was utterly convincing  and the supporting cast was excellent  though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel  yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events  it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film  or the story fails to convince  throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices  exception  men are shown burning to death with relative frequency   for example  we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground  here and there men lose limbs  in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety  theres an explosion  and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man  but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact  there are no shoes with only feet in them  no limbs scattered everywhere  no torsos without limbs  no charred corpses  and most importantly  all corpses have heads  in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds   the relentless dehumanization of the war  in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity  is softpedaled in the film  ultimately  saving private ryan bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war  rather than saying saving private ryan is  realistic   it would be better to describe it as  having realistic moments   another aspect of the  hollywoodization  of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular  the lack of swearing  anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war  such as fussells superb wartime  understanding and behavior in the second world war  which has an extensive discussion on swearing   knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup    who is this private ryan that we have to die for him   asks one infantrymen in the group of eight  rendered in wartime demotic  that should have been expressed as  who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him   or some variant thereof  conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the  f  word  and largely about  the search for  food and sex  this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an  r  rating due to violence  so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film  however  the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic  the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg  he cannot just cede control to the material  he has to be bigger than it  as if afraid to let the viewer find their own  perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear  emotional foothold in the material  spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had  the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary  reminscent of the closing scene from schindlers list   the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close  every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car  tiepin or ring could have saved another jew   quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson  captain millers last words to private ryan  and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain  that particular subplot is so hokey  so predictable  it nigh on ruins the film  nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness  stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat  imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage   because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii  saving private ryan can only pan for small truths in the shallows    ,0,1

197,to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie  mulan is a whole new world  the mouse factorys latest feature is a treasure  featuring magnificent animation  a strong story and finely drawn characters  mulan is the story of a fiesty  headstrong young woman who  unlike other disney heroines  isnt seeking her prince charming  mulans motivations are simple  to save her father  serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say  the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation  the emperor has called for a conscription  one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation  mulans crippled father is called  but mulan sneaks off  steals his armor and takes his place  mulan is a saga of courage and selfdiscovery  yet  despite the grim backdrop of war  it is a lively tale of selfreliance and brainoverbrawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy  the movie utilizes a strong corps of asianamerican talent as the voices for the main characters  including the wonderful mingna wen  the joy luck club  as mulan  b  d  wong as shang  mulans commanding officer and later love interest  pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soontek oh as mulans proud  but loving father  also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon  sent by mulans ancestors to watch over and help the young woman  his fast  wisecracking  hiptalking mushu may seem out of place  but its a crowd pleasing performance  especially for the youngsters  the movie features only a couple of songs  fewer than most previous disney animated flicks  but mulans are winners  the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot  the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus  mulan is a treat  more powerful than hercules  with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame  at about  minutes  mulan moves rapidly  and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end  mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain  also  it is hoped that the success of mulan  and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle  will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asianamerican themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production  it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication ,1,1
198,movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good  the bad  and the despicable  i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in   but i wanted to rewrite it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics  we need to be warned about some truly awful films  too  this picture was so bad  it inspired the description for my  rating  see ratings chart below   the only thing saving it from a  rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno  so  it does indeed have some plusses    in fairness  elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff  and her ability to whine and irritate us  even while nude  was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  this character is not smart  not interesting  and  deliberately   far too annoying far too often  like in s  bulworth   when the movie was over i didnt care one little iota about the main character  at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film  though    showgirls  is too stupid to make a statement  some people claim that the story is based on the legendary  all about eve  of all things  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was  hed be    well  hed be a good screenwriter  instead  this project may have sunk his career  he wrote the  ha ha   script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed  the same team who created a good sexfilm in    basic instinct   struck out here with their occasional violence  gratuitous xrated sex scenes  and numerous  and quite unnecessary  lesbian overtones  the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer  after the supposed streetsmart young  lady  gets conned out of her suitcase by a slackjawed yokel in the opening sequence  she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the  stardust hotel   nomi doesnt take advantage of this contact to break into the bigtime of dirty dancing right away  first  she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club  she sells her hot little wares at  the cheetah  for a short time  turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience  hey  i never said she wasnt a hot number    maybe its that  her body  which gets her into the bigtime when the star of the  stardust hotel   crystal connors  gina gershon  stops into the strip club  it certainly isnt her brains or pleasant disposition    crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend  kyle maclachlan   he also happens to be the pleasureseeking worm who runs the big show  crystal gets nomi onto the  stardust  team and  after an interminable amount of time  nomi  earns  the role of crystals understudy  the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal  it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that shes  not a whore   thats a phrase we hear a few different times and its completely ludicrous  of course she is  she sells her soul to make it big  but in the end were supposed to believe that shes a better person than that  were supposed to root for her  no way  shes a tramp and a backstabber who deserved nothingleast of all vindication in the    ahem    climax  she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  the subplot with a male dancer  glenn plummer  who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more  it sure aint character development  plummer also appeared in  speed  in  in a smaller  yet better role  this subplot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control  kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big payday or his standards have dipped since appearing in  blue velvet   that picture was weird  but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the s  now ol kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the s  too  his sleazy character is important to  showgirls   but we dont learn anything about him  he uses people to get what he wants  but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie  is he a villain  who cares  ultimately  this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit  everyone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation  especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool  what few reviewers take issue with is how meanspirited this movie is  everyones either having sex  exacting revenge  or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge  its just too hard to take  especially for over two hours   if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world  why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers  grunts  and other sounds during the dance numbers  its hard to care about these people if we cant even appreciate what theyre capable of doing onstage  berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body  after all  the world of porn is still an active  dishonourable profession  perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford  oops  theyre bad actors  too  well  at least  theyre not selfish and contemptable like good ol slutty nomi malone  useless triviaironically  elizabeth berkley played virtuous and  holier than thou  jessie on the teenybopper tv show   saved by the bell   before breaking onto the big screen  ,0,0
199,one of the sweetest tales to ever be made  its a wonderful life isnt perfect  but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results  probably the greatest  feelgood  film of all time  its a wonderful life aims for the heart  and strikes with a golden arrow  on christmas eve  george bailey  stewart  is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls  you see  george is in trouble  and he has always helped others who needed it  this one time  however  god answers his prayers  and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence  travers  to try and save george  clarence has got his own problems  however  clarence is an angel without his wings  and each time the bell rings  the wings pass him by  the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel  but before clarence can save george  he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george baileys life  we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brothers life  sacrificing his college education to save the family business  sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother  and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else  when the bank his family owns is in trouble  george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank isnt sold to the evil mr  potter  barrymore   who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls  one christmas  potter gets his chance  uncle billy bailey  mitchell  loses    of the banks money  without the money  the bank must close down  george is stuck in a tremendous bind  and contemplates suicide  clarence  the faithful servant  is there just to pick him up  and to show him what bedford would be like without george  this is all a leadin to the very famous last scene  where george finally sees what true happiness is about  its a wonderful life does have its faults  the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details  especially in the treatment of women and men  the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the s  like something out of a revisionist look  all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film  there are  however  endearing moments in all of this  capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  the story is hackneyed  and the ending feels  well  a little too sugarish  theres this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything  especially the sequences where george is either in trouble  or helping somebody  its a little too nice for my liking  at times  there is  however  enough humor  enough wit  and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part  which would be the most difficult  but watching its a wonderful life is never boring or difficult  its always interesting  right until the finale  which  for all its sugar  makes delightful sense and is beautifully done  capra does have his monumental cliches  but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection  donna reed is perfect as the loving  obeidient wife  and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr  potter  everyone else is magnificent  including bert and ernie  ward bond and frank faylen   there is a general sense of goodness  as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film  and they relish that  stewart  however  is the king of all of this  he is sometimes awkward  especially when saying  merry christmas  to all objects  animate or inanimate  but he is james stewart  and hes lovably delightful throughout the film  have i complained  i shouldnt have  this is a really good movie  no  this is a great movie  better yet  this is a phenomenal movie  there is a reason classics are invented  to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life  this is one of those films  it is a  feelgood  movie  something people complain a little too much about  but capras reworking of  a christmas carol  is the greatest christmas movie of all time  there  ive said it  i have to admit  the first time i saw this  i saw it with my family  including my  year old kid sister  they all loved it  they loved george  his wife  his troubles  and the beautiful ending  is it a little too sugarcoated  maybe  no matter  this is a film that should be watched time and time again  with families around a coffee table  and eggnog on the plate  it is a film that just makes you feel good about life  family  and hope  it is the perfect christmas film  flaws and all  it is frank capras greatest acheivement  and that really does say a lot  for about  out of  minutes  this movie is flawless  the rest can be excused  no film is perfectly flawless  i cant get over how much i love this movie  and how much you will  after watching it  digesting it  and sitting with your family  appreciating how special life really is  ,1,1
200,one of the last entries in the longrunning carry on series  carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a caravan site  professors anna vrooshka  elke sommer  and roland crump  kenneth williams  and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep  kenneth connor  so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains  anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick   for instance  when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan  she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan  arthur upmore  bernard bresslaw  and his wife linda  patsy rowlands  take her mother daphne barnes  joan sims  and her minah bird on holiday with them  motherinlaw jokes prevail  furthermore  the trouble that joe and norma baxter  ian lavender and adrienne posta  have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families  fred ramsden  windsor davies  and ernie bragg  jack douglas  leave their wives  liz fraser and patricia franklin  behind for a fishing holiday  however  they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls  sandra  carol hawkins  and carol  sherrie hewson   the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the daytoday running of the camp  the search for the minah bid and greyhound  the major  fred and ernies desperate need of a woman  a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan parks pub  and a shock in store for daphne  the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing  this is what binds the movie together  joan sims stands out as the demanding motherinlaw  bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife  and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast  on the other hand  there are lowkey performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman  and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman  there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors  although the regular cast is depleted  the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film  a relative flop at the cinema  this movie deserves a lot more recognition  ,1,1
201,i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world  and i wish that filmmakers would use commandments as a blueprint on how not to do it  writerdirector daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner  aidan quinn   a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires countrywestern lyrics  his pregnant wife drowns  his home is destroyed by a tornado  he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning  convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant  seth decides to break his  and sets out to turn every  thou shalt not  of the ten commandments into a  thou shalt   and vice versa   his wifes sister rachel   friends   courteney cox  wants to help seth  rachels selfish husband harry  anthony lapaglia   who tends to break a few commandments of his own  thinks seth is a lunatic  thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion  taplitz isnt interested in treating seths tragedies as genuinely tragic  making it impossible to sympathize with him  composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds  turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark  quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain  the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought  with one through five dispatched in a fiveminute montage  the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a highconcept movie plot  its not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth  corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has  while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seths  false witness   only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance  she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve  even she cant force taplitz to decide whose story this is  or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite  by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film  it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience  commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith  and the loss thereof  at all seriously  ,0,0
202,originally titled dont lose your head  this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions  two english fops  the powdered  bewigged  beribboned sir rodney ffing  sidney james  and his counterpart lord darcy pew  jim dale  decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine  due to a series of machinations and disguises  they are largely successful  ffing becomes known as the black fingernail because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up  one with a black fingernail  after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit  charles hawtrey   citizen robespierre  peter gilmore  orders the head of the secret police citizen the big cheese camembert  kenneth williams  and citizen bidet  peter butterworth  to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him    in fact  darcy and ffing are their coachmen   once at calais  the fingernail meets jacqueline  dany robin  and they fall in love instantly  he tells her his identity and gives her his locket  when camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby  he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline  thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail  jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert  his love desiree dubarry  joan sims   and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail  they pretend to be of noble stock  calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante  with bidet their assistant  and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing  desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck  but she ends up falling in love with him  ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline  camembert has her moved to the chateau neuve  and a climactic swordfight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film  a more complex story than most carry ons  this film enjoys good production values  sets  costumes  and an onform cast  sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail  kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert  and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camemberts thickwitted crony  other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit  although it suffers from a disasterously overlong sword fight at the end of the film  it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars  its slick and professional production  and its betterthanusual script  definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch  ,1,1
203,here is a film that is so unexpected  so scary  and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop  okay  it isnt quite original  considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species  but it certainly is smart  most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the s and s  and some even become them  however  as we learned with the  smallbudget horrorscifi film  sometimes expectations can be shattered  a lot of criticism has gone against this film  from what i have read so far  anywayyep  all two reviews   and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory  laughable pieces of trash  but  the thing is  it isnt  its well made  well acted  and quite intelligent  i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  but the species series isnt about the lack of these elements  its about how much it can get into one film  and yet  behind it all  it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so  species ii begins in the present day  though it seems to be an alternate universe  many films  especially scifi ones  create similar timelines as our realistic one  but change it to fit the films needs  species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft  the excursion  landing on the surface of mars  aboard is patrick ross  justin lazard   a very bright and very handsome astronaut  patrick is the son of senator ross  james cromwell   who just wants patrick to succeed  well  it would seem that he has succeeded  landing on the surface of mars  he is the first human being to ever do so  of course  he isnt the first ever  about a billion years ago  an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life  now  of course  the red planet is cold and rocky  no life lives on it  that is  no visible life  patrick  upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil  collects samples from the ground  he takes them aboard  and puts them in storage  unfortunately  one of the samples contains a form of life  and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship  just prior to heading back to earth  this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings  they pass out for approximately seven minutes  and then shrug it off as nothing  because they cant even remember  they blame it on a technical malfunction  back on earth  patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  as we know from the original  this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  however  the children that are bred are halfhuman  as their father is  patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with  and he finds it in eve  natasha henstridge   eve was cloned from dna taken from sil  the original alien  however  this time around  most of her  alien  urges have been either decreased dramatically  or lie dormant  the project is led by dr  laura baker  marg helgenberger  reprising her role from species   and her motives seem respectable  since she was involved with the original alien attack  she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again  and it has  storywise  species ii is much stronger than its predecessor  but it is also much stronger than  say  aliens  hey  i love the film  but you cant tell me it was strong on story   what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college  we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars  later  it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it   the script uses this effectively  but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot  beginning with the first man on mars  something i have always dreamed of seeing   i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  and it does it quite well  the characters are all smart  and they know what to do and what not to do  the only character that seems a little cliched is the general  george dzundza   and yet  he remains logical in everything he does  there are the obvious flaws of course  mostly lying in the technical aspects  the special effects are only mediocre  and some are just plain bad  but for the most part  they remain believable  i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children   also  the most realistic ones are usually the goriest  ranging from people being torn open  or someones head being blown off  however  some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience  including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex  nudity  and gory violence  however  i tend to disagree  what were the alien films about  and  if an alien species ever did come to earth  and their sole purpose was to destroy us  wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible  my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  i didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with  i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one   the acting is quite good for this kind of film  it is a vast improvement over the first film  at least  the acting is the key element to this film  if it was bad  it would have lowered itself into camp  if it was good  it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  okay  so it isnt that good  george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting  as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  natasha henstridge is limited this time around  as she is usually enclosed in a cage  however  she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  oh yeah  and shes quite fun to just plain watch  marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around  and her performance is probably the best in this film  michael madsen is soso  but he isnt annoying  and he soon becomes rather appealing  with his nice cynic personality   james cromwell has a small part  but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor  as i say  any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability  mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance  and he gives the film a more downtoearth feel  and  of course  justin lazard  lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance  but i think he is effective  sure  he is wooden  but isnt that what his character is like  the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done  due to the couples acting  species ii is rated r for strong sexuality  scifi violencegore and language  this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see  more than likely  they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives  hell  i dont even know if i will  what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year  i probably wont see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while  director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful  and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series  medak has also mastered the wonderful  jump   moments  and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film  scream still has the first   strong acting  smart dialogue  intelligent plotting  and a surehanded director  species ii is exactly what these films should be  entertaining  ,1,1
204,what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection  sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have  i will prefer it to a bettermade film that is not as thoughtprovoking  the thin red line is flawed but it provokes  terence malick returns to filmmaking  years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war  unlike this years saving private ryan  which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof  the thin red line simply says war is waste  while that might seem obvious to some  only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is  saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost  the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs  one message is not necessarily more correct than the other  it just depends on ones point of view  in malicks film  war is set in a tropical paradise  and john tolls cinematography is beyond lush  the setting poses the question  why are we fighting in the face of such beauty  in saving private ryan  the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go  in the thin red line  the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place  they are just like the americans  frightened and angry  grieving and praying  all that separates them is war  the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voiceovers  unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious  sometimes corny  the voiceovers tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary  dispensing with them  malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur  instead  he gets distracting selfconsciousness  aside from that  malicks direction is stunning  the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary  sean penn  elias koteas  and nick nolte give the best performances  penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism  koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain  and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle  john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles  ultimately however  the thin red lines interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama  it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure  but malick clearly has different things on his mind  has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative  what malick is working with is theme  and in that  the thin red line is most provoking  ,1,1
205,after hearing reviews for woody allens upteenth movie in history   celebrity   range from terribly boring to just soso  my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of  manhattan   my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time  woody allens films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair  so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit handinhand   manhattan  really is one of the bestlooking films ive ever seen  beautiful black and white photography of the citys best areas  etc    a fan cant help but feel visibly moved  the film opens up  with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds  and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack  but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky  with the word  help  being spelled with an airplane  beethovens th blasts on the soundtrack  the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment  and its all rather lovely to look at  and then we cut to a film crew  shooting this as the films hilariously banal key moment in the film  where the lead actress in the film  melanie griffith  looking as buxom and beautiful as ever  has to realize somethings wrong with her life or whatever  its a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film  with the great opening shots or without  and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again  a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works  though  for the record  last years  deconstructing harry  came awfully close   what the hell has happened to him  the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny  but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas    bullets over broadway   though wonderful  relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off    mighty aphrodite  is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story    everyone says i love you  was more of a great idea than a great film  even  deconstructing harry  is admittingly cheap in a way  even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films  if anything  the reception of  celebrity  by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time  its not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is  its him    celebrity  is  yes  a good film  but its only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film  instead of creating the great woody allen world  hes created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about  and hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities  so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  its like  la dolce vita  without the accuracy  the right amount of wit  and the correct personal crisis  woody  becoming more insecure in his old age  choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities  and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny  and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead  much has been said about his performance  dead on but irritating  makes one yearn for the real thing  blah blah blah  but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branaghs performance  though featuring some of the same mannerisms  stuttering  whining  lots o hand gestures   is hardly a wartsandall impersonation  branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm  which actually allows for his characters flaws to be more apparent  woodys a flawed guy  and we know it  but we love him anyway  because hes really funny and really witty and really intelligent  branaghs allen is a bit more flatout bad  but with the same charm so that  yes  we like him  but were still not sure if hes really a good person or not  his character  lee simon  is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie  hits on extra actress winona ryder  then goes off to interview griffith  who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her  and she denies him    sorta  we then learn  through flashbacks  that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a midlife crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion  he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts  covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate  so that he can meet them  and maybe sell his script  a bank robbery movie  but with a deep personal crisis    as such  he has divorced his wife of several years  allen regular judy davis   and continues on a quest for sexual happiness  boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film  after griffith comes his escapades with a model  charlize theron  who is  polymorphously perverse   glad to see allen is using new jokes  ha ha   who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of  la dolce vita   following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen  a relationship that almost assures him success  and his continued escapades with ryder  whom he fancies most of all  his story is juxtaposed with that of davis  who flips out  but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome  friendly tv exec  joe mantegna  who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status  while lee is fumbling about  selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness  davis becomes happy   ive become the kind of woman ive always hated    and im loving it    without doing a thing  the result is a film of highs and mediums  the mediums are what take up most of the film  with sitations and scenes which dont exactly work but you cant help but pat allen on the back for trying  but other places are really great scenes  the opening  the sequence with theron  which is so good that i wished it hadnt ended  a banana scene with bebe neuwirth  droll as ever   and  perhaps the best sequence  a romp with hotashell teen idol  brandon darrow  played by none other than leo dicaprio  who is so undicaprioesque that if any of this fans could sit through this film  theyd never look at him the same way  he ignites the screen with intensity  and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical  and totally heartbreaking for lee  who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read  and finds himself on a wild allday ride with him  they go to atlantic city to watch a fight  they gamble  and they wind up in his hotel room  where darrow gets it on with his flame  gretchen mol  and he lends him one of the leftover groupies  allens writing in these scenes are so good that just for them  id almost recommend the film  almost  but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that its a mess  despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself  its still a smart and insightful film  though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced  some seem too cartoonish  even for this environment   allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities  as it may seem to be  if it were  itd be extremely outoftouch   but about those who want to be celebrities  and how they equate celebrityhood with happiness  we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if theyre really happy  they may appear to be on the surface      but we do get close enough to lee and davis character  lee is obsessed with the phenomenon  while davis takes is at arms length  and never gets too involved in what it is  and soon becomes one herself  besides  its witty  and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allens  that great woody allen feel  it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject  and yes  as a part of woody allens oeuvre  its merely a blip  no  annie hall  but its no  shadows and fog  either   but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him  and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor  like the one in the beginning  and make it work not once but twice  ,1,1
206,when i first heard about scream in   i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies  from the master of the horror himself  wes craven  it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them  by making the teenagers do what they know theyre not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them  dont run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door  never say  ill be right back   etc    when i first heard this description  i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie  how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  was this wes cravens remedy from making  real  bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn  it just seemed cheap to me  then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes  involving drew barrymore and a nailbitingly intense phone conversation  completely changed my attitude  scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick  its also a pretty scary movie  if youve seen a million of these kinds of films  you know exactly what is going to happen  this is part of the fun of watching scream  the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent  attractive teenagers  to those who rarely see these types of movies  scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film  theres nothing wrong with that misjudgment though  i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience  the newbies to horror and the fanatics  their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive  from these varied reviews  i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories  films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed  in my opinion  if it was not for the outstanding success of scream  the low  budget  gem may  alongside pulp fiction  be the most influential film of the s  this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself  we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors  screenwriters  and directors  scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quicklypaced script by kevin williamson  within the film are characters who tell other characters  as well as the audience  the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie  mainly from the rants of randy  jamie kennedy  and stu  matthew lillard   we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well  the virgin always survives  have sex and youre dead meat   not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors  the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction  in this case  williamson finds these errors for the audiences satisfaction and amusement  i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream  which is a spoof of scary movies  i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than screams perfect subtlety  however my last gut feeling about this stuff  scream  was dead wrong    so who knows  ,1,1
207,the s produced two brilliant science fiction films  one was gattaca  the other was the thirteenth floor  just as gattaca was overshadowed by the mighty titanic  the thirteenth floor was relegated to obscurity by the matrix  however  the thirteeth floor  though it deals with similar themes  is a much better movie than the frenetic  childish and improbable matrix  a cutting edge computer scientist  hannon fuller  played by the charming armin muellerstahl   is murdered  his associate  douglas hall   craig bierko  apparently framed and suspected by the police  enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery  along the way a beautiful blonde  gretchen mol   more bodies  and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture  the thirteenth floor unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches  choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise  the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view  first  its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline  second and more seriously  it demands that its audience think and feel  no wonder it fell through the cracks  done in film noir style as a murder mystery  this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels  many audiences will simply be bewildered by it  rather than engaged  which is a shame  because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment  i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie  despite its philosophical challenges  the thirteenth floor derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller  mol  and douglas hall  bierko   as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller  in that sense it is more akin to gattaca than the matrix  which  for all of its cute philosophical byplay  is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever  the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying  wrenching and intellectually challenging  in its final moments the film even takes on itself  when david  janes husband  who has come to enjoy killing  accuses her of being the sick one  although there is a victory for the leading characters  this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane  and thus a deepseated character flaw  in fact  hannon fullers activities in the simulated world  the behavior of janes husband  and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters  this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil  the tragedy is not in their stars  but in themselves  the major actors  all of whom are required to play two or even three roles  perform extremely well  bierko  who will be familiar as the psycho from the long kiss goodnight  is outstanding  donofrio as whitney  who plays a pivotal role in support  also turns in a good performance  the lovely gretchen mol  whose elegance  integrity  and determination suggest bergman in casablanca  does a wonderful job  her voice  however  lacks the necessary weight at times  this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script  some minor flaws  hairline cracks in fine porcelain  appear in places  there are one or two instances of jerky editing  the script takes the edge off the films climaxes  the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times  yet  there is a clue there too   one wonders if even after two decades  blade runner is still casting its long shadow over scifi films  one can see a group of suits in their suite  waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in amadeus   make it more likeblade runner  you know  dark and rainy   the thirteen floor is that rare exception among hollywood movies  a  rich  emotionally satisfying  intelligent scifi movie  and yet  ultimately  it proves the suits right  for when good scifi is made  where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it  if we dont support great sf  who will  ,1,1
208,if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films its their predictable endings  the devils advocate has the atypical hollywood ending  when everything that should happen does  unfortunately for the devils advocate  this ending nearly collapses in on itself  and ruins the entire film  nevertheless  the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment  note to self  kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film   i dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  well  it does contain this element  but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements  and seemingly more interesting ones at that   the devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  kevin lomax  keanu reeves  is the defense attorney  working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  he ends up with a notguilty verdict  despite an emotional testimony from the victim  heather matarazzo   he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann  charlize theron  where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  he accepts  mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive  and he flies to new york with his wife  after proving his worth for selecting juries  and his perfect winning streak in court   the head of the firm  john milton  al pacino   asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  he graciously accepts  where he is treated almost as a god  he is given an incredible apartment  which is bigger than my entire house now   and a hefty paycheck  his life seems to be on the rise  and of course  his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  he is attracted to fellow employee christabella  connie nielson   and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice  especially if it is not wanted  meanwhile  kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen  craig t  nelson  who apparently murdered three people  he spends hours upon hours with this case  while forgetting his loving wife  who may or may not be going insane  all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  after a while  things turn completely upsidedown  as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  a fellow employee is murdered in the park  and his mother  judith ivey  reveals information about kevins real father  is it all just a big nightmare  or is john milton really satan  playing tricks with kevins life  the devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward  but for some odd reason  the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect  is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed  if so  the devils advocate messes up completely  and ironically  i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now  than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  i went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film  and that is exactly what i got  i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally  and that is what i got  but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending  did i mention that i didnt like the ending    the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending  they pull the rug out from under you  films like seen and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected  more or less  we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  the devils advocate  on the other hand  ends unpredictably  not from us knowing a lot  but knowing nothing at all  if that is confusing  i recommend watching the film  and then reading that again  as for the film overall  i enjoyed the entire first two hours  being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  the film runs like a wellbuilt clock  slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax  and an unpredictable one at that   and then you settle in for a nice resolution  which does not occur  it was at this point that i felt cheated  taking us on a terror ride of intrigue  we follow kevin lomax around  as he is the centerpiece of the film  everything occurs from his perspective  he is our representation on screen  sort of   but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  i dont want to spoil the ending  so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  perhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything  it earned its r rating for a reason  there is plenty of nudity  sex  violence  gore  and then you have gore  violence  sex  and more nudity  this film really isnt subtle about anything  showing us everything  it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc rating  as it is quite harsh  however  the movie does have its merits  and nudity and sex are among those  i dont condone sex and nudity in films  but if its there  i might as well enjoy it  the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining  but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife  mary ann  portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron  mary anns problems are incredibly intense  and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  this may sound uncaring  but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  she is the most interesting character on the screen  who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  something the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity  especially for a film of this nature  the story actually has something to say about humanity  in one of the last scenes  john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children  he is satan  of course   he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity  then  god sets up rules which contradict human nature  this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening  what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud  partially thinking it was funny  but patially realizing it was true  these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate  giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing  but im sure they came straight from the novel it was based on   when a film has something to say about our society  it deserves to be watched  the cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights  as we see memorable faces  and they put spins on those memorable faces we dont expect  heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case  and she does a great job  probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves  he has proven himself an uneven actor  successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic   but he tops himself with this performance  i have never seen him more believable to date  al pacino is of course the scene stealer  his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson  the witches of eastwick  and max von sydow  needful things   he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes  but he remains completely believable  if that is the correct term   jeffrey jones  mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off  also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon  judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevins past  connie nielson is very effective in her role  and she also appears naked several times  one familiar face with a twist was  coach  star  craig t  nelson  who gives a very good performance  the devils advocate is rated r for sexuality  nudity  violence  language  and some gore  at  minutes  this film moves along fairly quickly  for the first two hours  i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters  the technical quality is also remarkable  with great special effects and a good musical score  director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture  only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes  i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film  and hackford gave me just that for a long time  but just before the end  he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream  personally  i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early  ,1,1
209,the verdict  spinechilling drama from horror maestro stephen king  featuring an outstanding  oscarwinning performance from kathy bates  geez  french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this  sorry  nonbritish readers may not be familiar with french and saunders  my apologies  the pair are british comediennes  jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in  absolutely fabulous    who did a series of film spoofs a few years back  including alien  the exorcist and misery  needless to say  amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates  the resemblance was quite uncanny    dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunders legs  but despite the lingering memory of their sketch  and although ive now seen the film a couple of times now  that  hobbling  scene was no less disturbing  im still left screaming at the telly in revulsion  that may be the most memorable scene  but its certainly not the only worth watching  stephen king  whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality  strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale  its a nicely crafted psychological horror  which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon  james caan   rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes  bates   who introduces herself as the writers  number one fan   he soon becomes her prisoner  both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance  for which she won an oscar  work arminarm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruitcake  or is that fruity as a nutcake    bates relishes her demanding role  and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour  at times shes a rather tragic character  and more often than not shes just damned scary  this is basically a very simple tale  but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity  its an involving  engrossing experience  and considering its basically a twohander  mainly set in one locale  its a remarkable piece of cinema  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences  this one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan  oh  i havent really mentioned caan yet  he does a good job as the writer whos a prisoner of his own success  annie is obsessed with him and his books   but  as you no doubt gathered from the above  bates is well and truly the star of the show  along with the pig  of course  anyway  the tension is builtup with masterful aplomb  and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense  theres the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerveshattering lengths to poison her wine  he succeeds  but    she knocks the glass over  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well  in the immortal words of homer j  simpson   doh    other nervewracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house  we cut to annie in her car  shes on her way home    he realises this and tries to get back to his room    cut to the car again  shes getting near    will he make it  ok  so these sequences arent exactly original  nor perhaps unpredictable  but they work  boy  do they work  if a film has you on the edge of your couch  biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense  then its doing something right  of course  the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned  hobbling   annie realises her captive has been out of his room  and shes going to stop him once and for all  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer  and    i feel ill just thinking about it  nasty  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand  and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho  and then were given one of the most ridiculously overthetop fight scenes ive ever seen  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter  set on fire  head smashed against the wall  and she just wont die  sheldon isnt in terribly good shape either  if it werent so gorey it would almost be laughable  but its a terrifically effective film  and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked  misery is a tight  tense  intense and chillingly entertaining thriller  the directing is firstrate  and the performances  bates in particular  contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem  wonderful stuff                     for more regularlyupdated film and tv reviews  check out my site  http  www  geocities  comhollywoodbungalow                  ,1,1
210,bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  chris columbus  the director who gave you  mrs  doubtfire   plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point  based on the short story by isaac asimov  it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human  which as you can imagine is very difficult  starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children  soon this robot  called andrew  robin williams  shows abilities that makes his owner mr  martin  sam neill  very curious  andrew is interested in art and music  he  enjoys  making clocks  which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions  it shows out that because of a small failure in the  electrical circuits  and  positronic brain  andrew has accidentally gained a soul  this makes him unique and his evil creators worried  then mr  martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasnt programmed to do  soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom  destiny and love  this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner  a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction  ever since that film  the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy  what makes us human  the thoughts  the emotions  is it possible to become human  at what point can we say to a robot  now you are one of us   these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach  it is obvious that columbus didnt take them very seriously  when you think about it  this film is not really meditating on the question  when is a robot no longer a machine  but a human being    but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding  andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being  and only the society has troubles with it  in other words  it is as far from reality as from the academy awards  further more  there are other annoying problems  to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than  years from now  this has not been done for obvious reasons  because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task  columbus is the first to have crossed that line  the result is  as you might imagine  primitive  unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort  the world is simply frozen in time  neither the society  fashion  culture or values have changed over  years  mom is still working at the kitchen  doing the dishes  when you think back to the late th century and then compare it to the world we live in today  youll see a slightly bigger difference  i am not saying that everything should change  it is unlikely that the human rights will change  but its even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science  technology and fashion  i suppose its possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale  but its really hard  robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way  as always he does a decent job  as does sam neill  but it doesnt really matter  it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience  pretty much like last years  meet joe black   this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve  great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten  when isaac asimov wrote this story  the future seemed far away and magical  everything seemed possible  now is the future of asimovs time  and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago  for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius vernes    leagues under the sea   so cant we accept this story as a potential reality  let us hope that next years  a  i   will be more rewarding  ,0,1
211,  oh my god  i sounded just like a mother   mrs  pascal  played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold  tells her son    didnt i sound just like a mother     you are a mother   her son marty tells her disgustedly    i know  but i still cant believe it  i look at you people and wonder  how did you ever fit in my womb   marty  you see  is a grownup twin  although his sister  who thinks she is jackieo  is certifiably insane  marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes  mother and daughter  played in a brilliant performance by parker posey  are both varying degrees of wacko  most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and meanspirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is  the daughters fantasy of being jackieo is probably the most sane part of her being  mrs  pascal is the sort that will not let jackieo keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level  she explains to martys new fiancee  lesly  tori spelling   soon after their first meeting that jackieo was holding martys private part when she came out of the womb  the dialog by wendy macleod  based on the play by mark waters  is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment  the script  reminiscent of a david mamet play  flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters  the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the familys out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane  in this storm are two sane individuals  the fiancee is a giddy  schoolgirl type  embarrassed by everything  a complete contrast to her rival jackieos bitter pseudosophistication  as the two twins younger brother  anthony  freddie prinze jr  plays the allamerica boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brothers fiancee that night    we all have our secrets   jackieo tells her potential sisterinlaw  and boy  does she have a few  this is a house filled with them    when lesly calls it the familys  home  to mrs  pascal  theyve never had a visitor before lesly  mrs  pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their  house    in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase   made for each other   the twins biggest  but not their only secret  is that theyve had a longterm incestuous relationship  they dont like to discuss it  although they are not particularly ashamed of it  perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy  this story never pulls its punches  jackieo tries in many ways  few subtle  to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his  in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackieo pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands  marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy  the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing  they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world  their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best  director mark waters keeps the shows energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace  his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it  jackieo is temperamentally incapable of being nice  and being jealous  she cuts lesly down mercilessly    were you poor   jackieo asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished    did you eat pies  chicken pot pies     pancakes actually  lots of pancakes   lesly replies with her usual sincerity    a donut king  so is she like the queen    jackieo cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king    are we entertaining royalty   with rolfe kents whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed  will it end in a big emotional explosion  a murder  people slowly cutting each other up with words  a familial catharsis  a weather disaster or what  the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere  and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell  ill not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise  the house of yes runs a blazing fast     it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations  mature themes  violent overtones and some profanity  the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers  i  e   treat the movie as it were rated nc  ,1,1
212,walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century foxs anastasia  but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios  the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about  disneys recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas  the hunchback of notre dame  and to a lesser extent  hercules  with anastasia  fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window  some may say  so what  its just a kids movie  well    if you have young kids  beware  as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpserotting rasputin zombie  whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way  consider yourselves warned  nevertheless  the animation is quite stunning at times  don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout  occasionally rivalling photographic quality  and yet in other scenes  the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd  which leads me to wonder    was this rushed to market to combat disney  the plot  as anyone who had read history before knows  concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in   not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened  as for the plot  go rent disneys candleshoe  youll see  of anastasia there  ,0,1
213,up until about a year ago  john travoltas career consisted of those  look whos talking  movies  notice how they never called them look whos talented  and the  bomb shout  which was bad enough to make most people scream   but somewhere along the line  travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again  weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in  would experience fame and fortune once again  while barry  robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a  straighttothecutoutbin album aptly named  size isnt everything   and of course  they learned that sales are everything   but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again  and i think we all know why  four words  contract with the devil  and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs  contract with america   no  satan is much more humane  anyway  yes  travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld  how do i know  i own the document in question  amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars  isnt it  get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction  with travolta as crime minion chili palmer  he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a bgrade director  gene hackman  and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game  sure  a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood  but i guess thats beside the point  palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made  so he sets out to convince big star martin weir  danny devito  to star in the movie  bringing along downandout horror actress karen flores  rene russo   who has already had affairs with hackman and devito  it doesnt take a las vegas oddsmaker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well  after the customary sexual tension and denial  which has been used in every comedy from  whos the boss   to speechless  it works in this case  unlike  whos the boss   although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also  complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too  along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting  get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction  despite the obvious similarities  this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year  yes  even better than halloween vi   get shorty is my kind of movie  one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence  im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on  are you getting this  shorty  ,1,0
214,the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all  what does takes place is more based on character development  the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people  nick  beth  carol and sid  what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at  nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield  arizona to butte  montana    and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different     carol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend  sid is a jointsmoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in  obviously based on a stage play  the problem with the movie is that theres a lot of things left out  its not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other  the reason why nick was fired from his job isnt mentioned  and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery  when he hasnt seen them for many years  set in a small  fictional   town in arizona was a good move  since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings  the name of the city is not important  this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future  particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her  not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with  but ill keep an eye on her in the future  interesting trivia  this was rated r in the us but rated barntill  ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it  ,1,1
215,this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday  jon bennet  played by andrew howard  is an extremely good assassin  as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him  he has become an unquestioning weapon  he is in the employ of a kingpin  david calder  far more evil than he is  but even assassins have innocent pasts  he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school  complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime  a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin  calder is a familiar actor in britain  though not frequently seen in the us  he was seen in the world is not enough  here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years  he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake  his lair is underground  apparently in a sewer  where he lives like the king of sewer rats  it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennets life  paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpins lair  he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness  by using semidarkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world  this is a world that is cold and unfriendly  sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see  this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach  we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that  the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross  but it is sarossys film all the way  it creates indelible images of evil  i rate it an  on the  to  scale and a low  on the  to  scale    i do hope they do not use the tagline  dont mess with mr  inbetween    ,1,1
216,director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films  you need look no further than die hard  he was director of photography   speed and last years twister for examples of his hi octane  edge of your seat thrill prowess  speed  is no exception  this time  the action takes place on a huge cruise liner  on which sandra bullock and jason patrick are trying to develop their relationship  yep  thats right  no keanu reeves this time  but fear not  jason patrick is more than up to the job  speaking of which  the job at hand is to stop completely bonkers terrorist  willem dafoe  from crashing the liner into a huge island  after stealing a diamond collection  the reason for this act of destruction is revenge  after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers  he contracts copper poisoning and is retired  naturally  what entails next is a lot of runningjumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day  thinking back on this film  you cant help  but admire its structure  the way  willem dafoe initiates his plan and throws red herrings to the crew and passengers  the race against time to save the liner from crashing  and of course  the finale chase scence    although this is ruined by an over the top  one too many stunt and explosion   simple in construction  effective in its execution  and the result  a clear and concise  highly enjoyable action film  the acting is adequate  although its darned obvious that sandra bullock is only in it to create a hot totty appeal to the men  and she does that perfectly    jason patrick fills the action hero role superbly and willem dafoe is just great as the crazed terrorist  overall  speed  is a most enjoyable thrill ride  not up to its predecessors high calibre but very good all the same  there is plenty going on  some of the thrills are quite tense and it also proves that you do not need blood and guts to make a good action movie  ,1,1
217,leonardo decaprio  whats eating gilbert grape  and claire danes  tvs my so called life  star in director baz luhrmanns modernized version of william shakespeares classic  romeo  juliet  surrounded by a superb supporting cast  including paul sorvino  goodfellas   brian dennehy  tommy boy   pete poslethwaite  the usual suspects  and john leguizamo  executive decision   decaprio and danes shine throughout the film  the story starts off at a gas station  where the  montague boys  meet the  capulet boys  and square off with one another  symbolizing the swords of shakespeares day were their weapons  like the  rapiermm  or the  longsword shotgun   instead of killing each other right away  they shoot around  just like in sword fights of old  another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeos best friend  mercutio  who in shakespeares novel was quite a stud  was portrayed as an africanamerican crossdresser whose violent nature  was a definite plus  miriam margoyles  a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliets nurse  even though she was never given a name  she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world  verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeares version  only slightly changed in luhrmanns  now known as verona beach  the capulets  led by sorvino  and montagues  led by dennehy  are now rival corporate dynasties  and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars  one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue  since it was spoken in old english  subtitles could have helped in the beginning of the movie  but toward the end  it became easier to understand  this excellent movie poses another problem  what genre is it  romeo  juliet contains so much drama  yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories  with the same awardwinning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction  romeo  juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece    ,1,1
218,  being john malkovich  is the type of film we need to see more  todays films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas  or those that have similar themes  malkovich falls under none of these categories  and its quite refreshing to see that occur  this strangely provoking story  is actually somewhat understandable  john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time  his wife  cameron diaz  supports the both of them by working at a petstore  which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment  when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job  he finds an ad for a filing clerk  when he reaches the building  he arrives at a   floor  its there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for  minutes at a time  meanwhile  cusack meets a business partner  catherine keener   in which he falls madly in love with her  the only problem is  she has no interest in him what so ever  the whole portal thing  isnt just a toy  in fact  it becomes cusacks dream  being inside malkovichs mind  gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich  like a puppet  and to fulfill his fantasies  i dont want to give away too much  but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery  in my opinion  this idea is absolutely brilliant  its really quite scary to think that someone could become you  control you  be you  it makes you wonder why we act like we do  and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue  even if the script is super sharp  i cant help but find the ending displeasing  it could have lead up to something more  or at least an amusing conclusion  it tried to explain a mythology about the portals  that made it seem rushed  other than that  i had a very enjoyable time  the acting was quite delightful as well  john cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability  and he does it well  hes by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity  but im hoping that will change  cameron diaz was her usual charming self  although i felt that part was wrong for her  but she pulled it off  john malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice  who elses mind would be better to explore  the director  spike jonze  who appeared in last months three kings really catches my attention with this project  i knew he was bizzare  but not to this extreme  he too is likely too receive media attention    being john malkovich  isnt an excellent film  but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite  whats even better is the films puzzling message    am i nick lyons  ,1,0
219,first troy beyer wrote the critically panned  b  a  p  s   now she makes her directorial debut  writing  directing  and starring in this subpar film about women talking about sex  though not without redeeming qualities  this film is bad  the basic story follows three single friends  jazz  beyer   lena  randi ingerman   and michelle  paget brewster   in their search for love  jazz has an idea for a local talk show  it would feature women talking about sex and dating  she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami  the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout  both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters  the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film  there are several moments of bad acting  corny dialogue  and emotional overextension  in a lowbudget independent film from a firsttime director  these faults can sometimes be forgiven  if the screenplay is fresh and solid  that is not the case here  the script suffers from random plot developments  there are four or five of these turns in the plot  each one raising the question  where did that come from   at one point  a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  we are supposed to be moved  but since the scene is completely unledup to  we really dont care if she and her mother get along  weve never seen her mother before  we never see her again  who cares  whats worse  these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy  at another point  a character announces that she cant have children  apparently  this is devastating  we wouldnt know this because she never talked about having kids before  but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her  the scene feels like an afterthought  its emotion manipulative and shallow  these scenes grow worse and worse  culminating in an absurd climax  two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing  one scene is a lovers spat between two minor characters  the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax  thinking on these scenes  it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities  but it does  first  it is original  we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups  and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea  its something i dont think has been the subject of a film  second  the interviews of the miami women are sincere  taken together  they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners  the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes  but each tile is some womans real experience  neither the picture of women  nor their picture of men  is truly representative  but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way  at some level  the stereotypes that emerge can be called true  i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their  likes  dislikes  skills  and thrills   but on the whole  its pretty bad  and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting  corny dialogue  and emotional overextension  ill give beyer one more strike  and then shes out  rated r  almost got an nc  for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity  ,0,0
220,some critics  including siskel  ebert  are on the record stating that martin scorseses raging bull  the story of boxer jake la motta  is the best film of the s  since there are still a number of s films that i havent seen  i dont feel qualified to make such a judgment  but ill say this without hesitation  raging bull is a great motion picture  and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january    and december    come close to its level  biopics often fall into one of two categories  overblown hero worship or a dry  dull textbook account  its rare that a movie with the moniker  based on the life of   comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining  raging bull is the perfect counterexample  and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre  the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta  a middleweight icon from the s and s  and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen  for all  minutes  director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro  in the title role  have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic  sad  and horrifying  historically  raging bull is said to be mostly accurately  with the lions share of the details culled from la mottas own autobiography  which was cowritten with joseph carter and peter savage   however  although la motta is credited as the movies  consultant   he was reportedly unhappy with the final result  because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth  insensitive lout  the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base  bestial impulses  paranoia  jealousy  and blind rage  sex and violence are inextricably linked  the title is apt  la motta is a raging bull  in the ring  he is a terror  not just beating his opponents  but destroying them  outside of it  he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  the two people who spar with him on lifes canvas are his wife  vicki  cathy moriarty   and his brothermanager  joey  joe pesci   these are the two who mean the most to jake  and who  as a result of his inability to trust himself or others  he loses  he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity  and  when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him  his lets loose with an explosion of violence  raging bull opens in  when la motta  an upandcoming fighter  is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class  over the years  he wins several key bouts  including one against his archrival  sugar ray robinson  johnny barnes   but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match  meanwhile  away from the ring  la motta falls in love with year old vicki  who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife  vicki becomes jakes greatest prize  a wife  in his view  is not a companion  but a possession  and the source of his most extreme pain  his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him  hence  he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else  perhaps even his brother    this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere   are you f   king my wife      in the late s  la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight  but with one huge condition  he must take a fall  he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing  two years later  he wins the championship  only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray  by the late s and early s  when the film ends  jake has become a pathetic figure  a broke  overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor  has lost his wife and children  and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine  raging bull is the other side of rocky  sylvester stallones tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in   it won the  best picture oscar  and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  but  where rocky romanticizes boxing  raging bull takes a cold  unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring  while scorseses primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man  he never backs away from showing the seedy  ugly underside of a sport where gambling  greed  and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working  rocky shows boxing at its noblest  raging bull shows it at its most diseased  theres little i can say here that hasnt already said about de niros performance  in a career that has included many fine roles  this is his most outstanding  the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering  and  although theres a lot of travis bickle  de niros character in taxi driver  in la motta  scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that  if we never fully sympathize with him  at least we understand the forces that drive him  this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting  as the younger jake  de niro is trim and fit  as the fat  older man  de niro gained  pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form  how many actors would go that far  the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance  cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work  although neither won   their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niros  pesci  who has basically recreated the same personality in two other scorsese films  goodfellas and casino   presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother  the misogyny and violence are still there  only better concealed  but  when joey snaps  as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster  frank vincent   its startling to behold  moriarty  on the other hand  must play the temptress with virginal qualities  the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake  later  shes called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear  scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in blackandwhite  a few  home movie  segments are in color   the choice is perfect for the movie  giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a blackandwhite approach is almost unheard of    one important recent exception  schindlers list  eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did   in blackandwhite  especially considering scorseses choice of shots and use of slow motion   the violence is stark and disturbing  theres no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas  during fight sequences  the director also uses a number of pointofview shots designed to show the world  however briefly  from la mottas perspective  scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la mottas loss to sugar ray  where he surrendered his middleweight crown  after that  his career was all downhill  yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment  stretching more than a decade into la mottas future  the reason is obvious  scorsese isnt as interested in boxing as he is in the character  following his retirement  la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever  but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies  we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self  who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brandos speech from on the waterfront     i coulda been a contenda    perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the s  and  if not  its certainly perilously close to the zenith  ,1,1
221,five years after his directorial debut based on stephen kings writings called the shawshank redemption     writerdirector frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king  unlike the latter film  this one is a big  long  laborious bore  plot  a sevenfoot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers  critique  this film is slow  drawnout  boring  uninteresting  unexciting  predictable and topped with a couple of onedimensional  evil  characters  its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles  the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward  unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about  of course  much like all other death row cell blocks  this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be  misunderstood   except for one cookiecutter crazy guy who is evil personified  and lets not forget all the guards on death row  who also happen to be angels from the heaven above  except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified  and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates      am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film  or even more importantly  am i supposed to give a rats ass about anyone in this film  well  if i was  i sure missed that boat  because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin  furthermore  there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story  in fact  the story is empty within itself  i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal  and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not  wow  how interesting  the plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film  we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie   whip out those thinking caps  kids  hmmm  and i wonder what will happen to those two cookiecutter  evil  guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity  hmmmm  now think hard here  boys and girls  what a crock  i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality  but unfortunately for me  it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging  in fact  it was one big bore  i didnt see the point of the movie  i didnt see the point of the story and i certainly didnt see the point in tom hanks big doublechin  all in all  a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work  especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour  john coffey  give that man an award or something  ,0,0
222,not since s shine  which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott  has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of worldclass musicians  in fact  if one were to watch these films together  it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills  yet hilary and jackie  the sophomore effort from director anand tucker  has something more to say  it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale  emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale  playing the sisters du pr   both musicians from childhood  hilary  griffiths  is renowned flutist while jacqueline  watson  is easily as skilled on the cello  the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women  both together and seperate  their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one anothers  and although their lives take very different paths  hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour  they are bound together by their deep family love  the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance  they contrast each other wonderfully  and while watsons portrayal of jackie du pr  is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic  both characters are charged with emotion  the frank cottrell boyce script  which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr   brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well  the script is also to be commended for its wellpolished dual nature  cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller  which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert townes script for mission  impossible  and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame  the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least  and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story  some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised  nevertheless  hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around  ,1,1
223,after the average mouse hunt  the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz  dreamworks try again with the childrens film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story  as the film warns us at the beginning  its not the full story  and some liberties have been taken  but generally this the bible story we all know and love  featuring burning bushes  the plagues and the parting of the red sea  the only thing missing is charlton heston  instead  we get val kilmer voicing moses  an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt  helen mirren   we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses  fiennes  all grown up  moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron  sandra bullock and jeff goldblum  that he isnt really the son of the pharaoh seti  patrick stewart  and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule  he soon sets about this  along with his wife tzipporah  michelle pfeiffer   rameses and his two wizard friends  voiced by steve martin and martin short  try to stop moses completing his task  while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults  for children reared on aladdin and hercules  this film could be the most godawful thing theyve ever seen  gone is the quick fire humour and standard  easy to follow plot  but  spectacularly  and to dreamworks credit  nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen  jeffrey katzenberg  who produced this film  certainly knows how to keep a child interested  hes included some songs in the film  plus some comedy  and a exciting chariot chase  to keep the children interested  and somehow  himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across  without ever being boring  its a remarkable achievement  also remarkable is the animation  which puts hercules  an almost slap dash effort  to shame  relying on hand drawn and computer animation  the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed  the film seems a little caught up with its amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and moving shots  but they do look incredible  the final plague where god kills every first born child  and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed  kudos to the animators  the vocal talent is also very good  val kilmer does a fine job as moses  although he doesnt sing  and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses  and he does sing   sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great  and steve martin and martin short are very good  but not in the film long enough  finally  michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife  kudos also goes to the voice of god  who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued  sadly  he is uncredited  and i couldnt quite work out who the voice was    but email if you do   the songs are good  ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number  they dont disturb the movie  and while not particularly memorable  they are nice to listen to  theyre well sung aswell   the musical score is suitably epic  with some beautiful tunes  coupled with the superb visuals  the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat  backed up with a great story  entertaining both for kids and adults  this film is a must see  a david wilcock review     you know  for kids   norville barnes ,1,1
224,jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh boxsets on the video shelves  he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the welloff  maybe its a classic case of displacement  its easier to see jarvis own lyrics  obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall  as a fetishization of lowlife  rather than leighs films  but its worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of workingclass characters dont make for a guarantee of authenticity  let alone a good film  its the triumph of secrets  lies  then  that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek authenticity and honesty in everyday lives  following her adopted mothers funeral  hortense  a young black optometrist  sets out to find her birth mother  and is disturbed to find out that she is white  it is cynthia  a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne  cynthias younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages  largely because of his wifes animosity towards her  hortense calls up cynthia  who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her  but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually  cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party  which maurice is hosting    secrets  lies has a simple enough theme at its heart  as one character puts it   best to tell the truth  isnt it  that way nobody gets hurt    but if the film delivers much more than a trite message  its because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths  even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us  hence  cynthias difficulty with acknowledging  first to herself  then to others  that hortense is her daughter  one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever  been with a black man   before a longsuppressed memory seizes her  at the party  cynthias pretense that hortense is her factory coworker leads her to ever more convoluted lies  as agonizing as they are funny  little lies seep into every corner  like maurice pretending that hes  just dropping by  when he visits cynthia after much deliberation  maurices job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme  a sadlooking bride that maurice coaxes to smile  a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles  one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face  she says she needs the photo to look  as bad as possible  to collect insurance money  yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars  there are occasionally hilarious moments  as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception   ive got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs   or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne   if youve got it  flaunt it  is what i say   as played by brenda blethyn  cynthia comes close to being a caricature  with her nervous  somewhat disconnected way of talking  but shes really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her  precisely because shes so needy of love  perhaps  indeed  the whole cast gives warmly rounded  detailed performances  the script was developed partly through improvisations  and the fusion of cast  script and director shows best in the party scene  seemingly everyone is talking at the same time  and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout  in a very different way  but also using a long single shot  the scene of hortense and cynthias first meeting in a lonely cafa achieves a touching intensity  all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings  the films climax  with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsenesque revelations  and everybody hugging each other  is the one thing that seems false about this film  however  its a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the characters lives  when cynthia says near the end  this is the life  innit   you get the sense that  following the cynicism of his last film naked  leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all  without comforting illusions  the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice  ,1,1

227,i dont know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people  but its something i used to wonder about when i was younger  i cant decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat  but im pretty sure andrew niccol  screenwriter for the truman show  has had the same curious thought  the truman show is about a man  jim carrey  whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public  since birth  hes been living in the fictional island town of seahaven  fla   which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign  all the people in truman burbanks life are actors  and the anonymous townfolk paid extras  people watch trumans life  hours a day  live  with no commercial interruptions  revenue comes instead from product placement  a staple of contemporary hollywood  with trumans friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones  the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else  even if you havent seen the truman show  youve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials  the trailer and other promotion blitzes  if anything ive written so far is a surprise to you  then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news  either way  you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it  because otherwise youll probably think it sucks  it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror  reciting the crucial  eat me  scene from alive  wishing his neighbors a good day  afternoon and evening  and living in domestic bliss with his wife  laura linney   but weird things start happening  a stage light comes falling out of the sky  truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father  we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child  sailing through a rainstorm  the death was staged by director christof  ed harris   who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island  similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth  not the least of them trumans best friend marlon  noah emmerich   who assures him hes not in on any conspiracy because the last thing hed ever do is hurt him  as trumans trusting eyes tear over  christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else  theres even a daily behindthescenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of trumans existence  the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama  because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions  and it all hinges on carrey  who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on  hes come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura  most fundamentally  its just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a persons life without the person realizing it  how they coordinate extras  hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors  the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this  sure  the most interesting tv genre of the s has been reality programming and jerry springers popularity is through the roof  but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves  and when news shows use hidden cameras  its done in the name of the greater good  not entertainment  but merge the two and youve got the truman show  right now  its implausible  i mean  the fcc wont let you say the sword on the air  do you think theyd let you broadcast every detail of a mans life to the entire world without his consent  one day  though  it could happen  and  even though it would mean the end of privacy  people would eat it up  you know they would  ,1,1

229,many people dislike french films for their lack of closure  while possibly shallow  ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany  or at least a resolution  in the films which i view  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional  however  the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passiondenying protagonist  stephane  daniel auteuil   stephane  daniel auteuil  is a master violin maker  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing  even the relationship between he and his boss  maxime  andre dussollier  is a controlled  and almost manipulated association  highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches  in the beginning of the movie  stephane is a closed  solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man  camille kessler  emmanuelle beart  is a master violinist and the new love of maximes  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife  like stephane  camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved  sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges  when stephane and camille meet  there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals  however  whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane  stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him  stephane ignores his feelings for camille  which the audience cannot help but to see is present  as the movie progresses  the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another  these two people  with very similar approaches to life initially  react to their new circumstance very differently  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled  while camille becomes more tempestuous  until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship  however  their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well  due to his relationship with a master violin teacher  however  apparently  he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing  consequently  stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays  in contrast  camille had almost given the violin  years earlier  however  with the aid of her manager  she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest  successfully submerging herself to her playing  during the course of the movie  we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions  stephane attempts to remain unchanged  however  we do see subtle hints of his transformation  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash  the development of all of the characters  many of which is not included in this synopsis  is incredible  american movies  with rare exceptions  have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development  in its essence  this movie is about the development and growth of the characters  camille and stephane  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie  including a death  is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters  i am not sure why berardinelli says   at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified  and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty   this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong  but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are  i find the ending appropriate  unfortunately  i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling  this portion of the film is where the  sense of closure  could have been successfully accomplished  unfortunately  there is a hurried and almost a soap operatype surge of emotions from all of the characters  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart  ravel has his day in this film  the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen  the directing in this movie is wonderful  the actors and actresses are excellent  each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth  emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful  and needless to say  i must say that emmanuelle beart  herself  is beautiful  besides the near ending  the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot  has their attitude towards love changed  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at  but i am unsure of which the director is espousing  in summary  this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship  in the process  we see their attitude towards life and other people  in itself  i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we  as americans  have preconceived american notions of relationship  love  and people  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture  however  i  bringing my american preconceptions  enjoyed the film  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it  ,1,1
230,the film may be called mercury rising  but that title doesnt describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture  a routine thriller that combines government coverups with a cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story  the  hook  that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  however  aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance  this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device  those expecting to see even a semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed  mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism  the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow  i dont know whether the problem is in the original book  simple simon  or in the screenplay adaptation  but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible  once again  certain standby plot elements  the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent  are recycled  and not to good effect  while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood  this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense  the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold  art jeffries  bruce willis   is confronted with his own failure  unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time  he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death  the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting year old simon lynch  miko hughes  when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player  soon  art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone  fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time  with the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just a step behind them  along the way  they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy  chi mcbride  and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest  kim dickens   why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player  apparently  the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called  mercury   to make sure it cant be cracked  they do the most intuitive thing possible  place a sample of it in a  nerds puzzle magazine   of course  no one can solve it  no one except autistic simon  that is  when he calls the phone number listed in the solution  he gets the nsa  as a result  the coldhearted  sneering government man  alec baldwin  decides that simon has to be eliminated  for the good of the country  of course  but he hasnt counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold  even though everyone in the audience has  its hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well  and does quite a few things rather poorly  for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like  mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime  but even the most exciting scenes  such as the one where art and simon are crouched down  avoiding passing trains  arent that pulsepounding  the climactic struggle is a real hohum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness  overall  director harold becker is constantly struggling  and failing  to generate even a moment that isnt derivative or obligatory  bruce willis star seems to be fading  this is his fourth straight lackluster outing  following last man standing  the fifth element  and the jackal  willis isnt terrible  but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through  and often does  alec baldwin  combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice  does some scenery chewing  but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace  the films real star is young miko hughes  heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare   who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual  but is about  years younger  mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain  the replacement killers  and u  s  marshals on the heap of pallid  thrillers  for those who like action and adventure in the theater  this has not been a good year  hopefully  the advent of summer will change that  until then  the best choices  for bruce willis or any other action hero  are on video  and  if youre determined to see mercury rising  check out the morning sky in early may  ,0,0

232,in my review of theres something about mary  i said something to the effect of  laughter isnt everything   i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate  laughter isnt everything  unless im watching a jim abrahams film  see  spoofs are easy with me  i love movies  and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love  sometimes im the only one in the theater laughing  sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison to my speaking voice  it cuts right through everyone elses laughter   sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film  abrahams latest film  mafia   induced this kind of hysteria upon me  its gotten some mediocre reviews  but  hey  im the guy who laughs at everything  there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film  but there are far more that work  and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness  i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking  most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things  like develop characters  shape stories  and other such nonsense  mafia  has no pretentions about characters or story  and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh  the film begins on the perfect high note  with a mockery of the opening of casino  our hero  jay mohr  is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car  which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire  to describe the story of mafia  is absurd and pointless  but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films  with a lot of casino references inserted throughout  along the way  the parodies seem arbitrary  and rarely victimize mob films  pictures like the english patient  forrest gump  and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing  movies like this rely on just a few things  but the most important element is direction  abrahams has been down this path many times before  hot shots   top secret   airplane   and any other film with an exclamation point in the title   and so i hold most of the success of mafia  to his experience  he takes just the right attitude in each scene  and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references  one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic  but it never develops   the actors are all energetic  which helps a lot with the tone of the film  mohr  suicide kings  paulie   who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors  is so good here  he looks like hes having so much fun that hes containing his laughter in every scene  watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool   hes probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material  lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brandos godfather  while pamela gidley is deadon in a fullblown mockery of sharon stone  the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that im supposed to give examples of things and be specific  unfortunately  i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia  that i cant remember a lot of what made me laugh  but thats a good sign  mafia  is so funny that i wasnt even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory  i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain  i know that doesnt sound particularly complimentary  but when watching a dumb comedy like this  the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain  finally  a film that does this for me  ,1,0
233,young einstein is embarrassingly lame  but that didnt stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia  where it became the third largest box office hit of all time  in the u  s   warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan  inxs  and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under  personally  im hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb  young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious  who not only wrote  produced  edited  and directed the film  but also starred and did his own stunts  his creation is about as stupid and contrived as youd expect from someone named yahoo  the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einsteins youth  whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany  the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania  a remote australian island  in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity  albert invents surfing  bubbles in beer  and the electric guitar  yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hicka clown with an insatiable curiosity  although yahoos performance is at first endearing  the onedimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say emc  yahoo has created a charming family for albert  and the scenes on tasmania are often clever  but after the first twenty minutes  the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy  young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot  yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack  unfortunately  the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing  almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video  the instrumental score  on the other hand  is generally playful  yahoo uses such classics as the   overture  and the theme from the good  the bad and the ugly to great comic effect  halfway through young einstein  i knew for sure the movie was a stinker  but it wasnt until the very end that i finally put my finger on why  the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies  such as young sherlock holmes  but from cheesy primetime sitcoms  in fact  young einstein might have been more at home on network television  where its sophomoric humor wouldnt raise any eyebrows  ,0,0
234,i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory  this was  of course  a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this  not only did i get to see an advance screening  i was able to see an advance screening of a  very good  movie  the very fastpaced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher  a fasttalking  witty  comical taxi driver in new york city  gibsons performance is terrific  and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films  gibson again teams up with richard donner  as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick  and this time around  the combination works even better  the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique  try to imagine a toneddowned version of travis bickle who  this time around  is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy coverups  if you can imagine that  then youve basically got jerry fletcher  in many ways  i was surprised by this movie  to begin with  i was surprised at how good it was  dont get me wrong  its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring  but it was a very enjoyable movie  secondly  i was surprised at mel gibsons performance  he provided a fantastic performance  the previews of this film led me to believe it was an allout action flick  which after viewing  it was almost the opposite in a certain sense  gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of oneliners  hilarious situations  and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film  for instance  jerrys apartment  and especially his security  is memorable  and last  i was surprised at how good the plot is  writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story  and when watching this film  you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers farfetched  or so they seem at first  conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions  mel gibson isnt the only standout in the film  julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton  the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher  who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories  he also seems obsessed and in love with her  but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories  she shrugs him and his beliefs off  continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him  jerry  obviously determined to continually seek out the truth  continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory  which will be printed in his newsletter  same title as the movie   although he only has five subscribers  he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work  and publishes his next edition  very soon after he does so  he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr  jonas  patrick stewart   after barely escaping alive  jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust  alice sutton  the remainder of the film is almost always fastpaced and full of action and suspense  with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy  and more along the way  the audience  and alice  learn more and more about jerrys life  many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience  for instance  the meaning of the book  the catcher in the rye  and its ties to assassins  the reason lone gunmen have three names  e  g  lee harvey oswald and james earl ray   and the real truth behind the grateful dead  make sure listen closely throughout the film  as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above  definitely  when conspiracy theory hits theaters august th  make sure you are standing in line to see it  i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film  especially if you are into an actionthriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations  and even if you arent  you should still like this film  ,1,1

236,at first glance  i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise  its plotline goes like this  the evil king cromwell  desiring to take over the world  resurrects an evil  ancient sorceror  xusia for power  he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents  given a triplebladed sword  which can shoot bad guys  like a gun  by his dying father  talon vows for revenge  eleven years later  when hes established his own army  the mercaneries  he vows to take back his kingdom  along the way  he meets up with alana  whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell  talon vows to help  and  after a series of minor escapades  eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother  and several other prisoners   only to be captured himself  in other words  put on a cross to be crucified    fortunately he frees himself  rescues alana from marrying cromwell  defeats xusia  and then cromwell  all with his triple bladed sword  during the final battle  the blade breaks  but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade   then  everything ends happily  unfortunately  the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping  bad acting  and gruesomely gory  bloody scenes  never once does the story seem to connect together  it just jumps around repeatedly  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia  after telling him that he needs his help  he leads the warlock out into daylight  but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards  wait a minute  didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan  which he cannot do by military force  if that is the case  why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him  and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway  these questions are just never  no  never  answered in the film  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life  another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell     and finally at the end  instead of settling down with alana  he just tells her to  wait   and then he just rides off  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes  this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure  even some attempts to make it exciting  a few fire scenes  battle scenes  dont work  it just completely fails altogether miserably  the only good thing about this film is its musical score  contributed by david whittaker  who had an  extremely  short music composing career  the score is boomy and adventurous  powerful  and a billion times better than this film is  my suggestion  steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead  if you can find it   ironically  though  before the films credits roll  there is a message indicating that a sequel  tales of the ancient empire  would follow  to my relief  and delight   it never got into production  because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office  grossing only  million  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer  all right  leonard maltin rightfully called it  second rate in scripting  and acting  and ataglance film reviews called it  a confusing  stupid  unimaginative  unengaging  bloodfilled bore   i totally agree with these reviews  all right  and i hope that this piece of   will be forgotten about  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review  but i am not laughing  in fact  my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its  minute running time  ,0,0
237,  tarzan and the lost city  is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while  not only it is poorly written  badly acted  and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas  it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid  unfortunately  its not bad in the way great  colossal misfires like  heavens gate     or  ishtar     were bad  instead  it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with  which begs the question of why it was made in the first place  with all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced  how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen  of course  tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history  he has appeared in over forty films  which have ranged from the very good  s  greystoke  the legend of tarzan  lord of the apes   down to the really bad  s  tarzan  the ape man  with bo derek   most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties  starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps  therefore  if another tarzan movie is to be made  one might assume that it would have something new to offer  a different angle  an original storyline  anything to set it apart from all the others    greystoke  added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale  and even  tarzan  the ape man  at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts    tarzan and the lost city   on the other hand  has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue  the script  by bayard johnson and j  anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come  comic books have better plots than this  the movie is so bad  in fact  that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy  george of the jungle   didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs  the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established  a quick opening narration tells of tarzan  casper van dien  being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes  and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage  when the movie starts in   he is a civilized english gentleman  without an english accent   and he is to marry jane  jane march  in less than a week  however  when a wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens  steve waddington  begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar  one of africas last great secrets  the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle  at first  jane refuses to go  pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding  but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down  therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman  once the film gets going  in its own sluggish way   it delves into a series of jungle adventures  as tarzan  jane  and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city  most of the socalled adventures are cheesy  predictable  and unexciting  with no pace  tension  or action to speak of  there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  ranging from  raiders of the lost ark     to  the goonies      when the movie is running short on action  it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals  releasing a baby elephant from a trap  and throwing ivory tusks into the river  the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality  for instance  when tarzan  who was raised in the jungle  is bit by a cobra  he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do  instead  he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival  of course  one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is  not to ruin the ending or anything  but there is no lost city  there is  however  a lost pyramid  which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with  the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie   which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid  when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field  strictly speaking   tarzan and the lost city  isnt even bad enough to have camp quality  although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close  this movie proves what  starship troopers  only hinted at  he cannot act  but he sure looks wellgroomed  even in the deepest heart of the african jungle  van dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan  hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth  i also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut  waddington makes a decent villain  although hes like a charmless version of belloq from  raiders of the lost ark   as jane  the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan  she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two  but whenever a snake comes into the picture  she is reduced to a hysterical mess  however  amidst all this complaining  i do have one piece of good news    tarzan and the lost city  is so lacking in ideas both new and old  that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid  so  we can say this much for it  at least it had the decency to be short  ,0,0
238,charlie sheen stars as zane  a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms  when he finally gets one  his boss destroys the tape and fires him  naturally  zane is not ready to give up  and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself  he is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico  so zane goes down there to investigate  and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly  zane is having marital problems at the time  and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting  hearing charlie sheen deliver the line   i guess there is something to be said for celibacy  is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames  this is just the setup  and i dont want to give too much away  because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises  charlie sheen  who has had a rocky career as of late  is in top form here  he is funny  serious  and determined to accomplish his goal  sheens absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie  the story is ingeniously devised by twohy  who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour  disaster in time  the films major flaw is a very slow pace  and not much happens in the earlygoings  viewers may be growing restless for a while  but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it  you will have a good time  ,1,1
239,  battlefield earth  is the best comedy of the year  it has to be  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider  bad movie syndrome struck me again  so after witnessing how much  battlefield earth  has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles  i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firsthand  is it as bad as advertised  oh yes  very much so  the plot is incomprehensible  the acting is atrocious  the special effects are mediocre  the action is dull  the implausibilities are legion  the dialogue is cringeinducing  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny  i dont even want to continue reviewing this movie  id like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible  but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory  so here it is  the premise is basically a ripoff of  planet of the apes   only minus the apes and philosophical discussion  and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo  the year is   the psychlos have conquered earth  and the human population has been enslaved  only a handful of humans escaped to radiationrich areas to escape the aliens  they live out their lives in fear  one man  johnny goodboy  i know  i know  tyler  barry pepper   ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos  there he confronts the psychlo head of security  a big  ugly  klingonlooking creature called terl  john travolta   pressed into slavery  johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back  meanwhile  terl is faced with his own problems  he has recently learned that hes stuck living on earth  which he hates  for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big mans daughter  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology  this is where the plot gets ridiculous       so the  mananimal  can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos cant go  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself  of course  his plan doesnt work  so many things wrong with this movie  where to begin  how about with travolta  whose hollywood clout brought about this  the cinematic version of scientology guru l  ron hubbards scifi novel  early previews for  battlefield earth   with constant shots of a makeupladen travolta cackling like lex luthor  had me  and several audience members  remarking   what the hell is travolta thinking   the movie did nothing to stem such remarks  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here  terl cackles after nearly every line  and so does every other psychlo  of course  this makes every scene hilariously overwrought  no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america  but ceos generally dont laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees     you were going to be promoted  but now youre not  fwahahahahahahahaha        its no big surprise terl loses to the humans  hes an idiot  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  he underestimates his enemies  assuming hell win just because hes smarter    he uses the word  leverage  like some sort of scientologist mantra   not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero  he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology    why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me   he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  no wonder this guy never got his promotion  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for    years  and how do all these previously braindead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly  theres a whole lot more to scratch ones head about in  battlefield earth   bring a scorecard to track the plot holes  director roger christian shoots  battlefield earth  in the most distracting way possible  tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls  and its awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue  the action sequences are atrociously edited  every one turned into an endless slowmotion parade that drains all potential excitement  are these things really so hard to construct  my respect for supposed  lightweight  action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in  battlefield earth  how badly an action sequence can be shot  this movie is an absolute headache  its not just the shot selection and editing  the movie  quite frankly  makes no sense  for most of  battlefield earths  running time  i just didnt know what was happening  it didnt have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical  though they certainly are   i really had no idea what the hell was going on  when i pieced the plot together later  it didnt look any better  heres how much of a disaster this is   battlefield earth  is already the worst movie of the year  and its going to take something really  really inept to top it  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it  in fact  id think that hubbards cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible  thatll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again  ,0,0
240,salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets  actors who demand such salaries might be greedy  but in some instances they are quite justified  because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation  proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies  and one fine example is breakaway   thriller directed by sean dash and starring  in  famous figure skater tonya harding  face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster  but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra  attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster  one day she decides to retire  but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that  realising that her life suddenly became worthless  myra starts running for her life  followed by professional assassins  terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater  although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities  her acting leaves much to be desired  on the other hand  her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality  believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name  martin sheens brother joe estevez  whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set  is the only bright spot of breakaway  unfortunately  he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film  ,0,0

243,dear god  this is a fantastically bad film  regardless of what i say about knock off  you cant grasp its awfulness from my words  you have to see it and experience it for yourself  heres the kicker  though  i suggest that you do so  yes  this is a bad film  easily one of the most incompetent films of the year  but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  in fact  i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time  despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  dont get me wrong  im not excusing knock off  it reaches an unacceptable level of badness  its so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon  michael wong  paul sorvino  and  of course  jeanclaude van damme  it does  however  have the entertaining presence of rob schneider  and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark  as i watched it  i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness  now  in retrospect  it seems clear that it wasnt  but its still a fascinating kind of mess  i dont like writing plot descriptions  it is  by far  the most boring part of writing a review   but  in this case  im off the hook  there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off  for the sake of comparison  i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing  i paid closer attention to knock off  and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray  and is accused by the cia  i think  of selling knock off products  knock off products are  of course  products that look like namebrand materials but are generic and cheap   i dont know what any of this has to do with martial arts  but there are lots of martial arts in the film  ray is good at martial arts  so when he has to beat up bad guys  theres no problem  rob schneider plays his sidekick  although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film  lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff  while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once  in fact  every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  in that order  knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  but what a strange mess it is  it was written by stephen e  de souza  who also wrote die hard and  hours  can this be the same man  i dont see how  unless  of course  huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time  knock off seems to have an interesting premise  as far as action films go   but theres no semblance here  for instance  van damme is introduced  and then seconds later hes running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong  why  who knows  what are the implications of this  i have no idea  most action films abandon depth in favor of action  and this is normally a problem  knock off  however  is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut  the acting is embarrassingly bad  rochon  in particular  delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity  sorvino  in addition  deserves better than this  van damme is bad  but hes charming in that bad way  and so i cant say that hes hard to watch  although i rarely understood what he was saying   the only exception is rob schneider  who is actually quite funny a lot of the time  tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison  theyre all pointless gimmicks though  such as shots of the innerworkings of a knock off running shoe  but his action scenes are never boring  one particular piece inside of a fruit factory  a fruit factory   is wellchoreographed  lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy  such as our heroes first encounter with the rochon character  but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous  i hope he did  for the alternative is a frightening thought  knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania  if it were boring  id give it zero stars  but its not boring  its loud and excessive and completely incoherent  its also funny  even when it isnt meaning to be funny  a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesnt deserve to be fully lambasted  i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness  but i cant deny its zany  useless charm  oh  i know  theyre just action scenes looking desperately for a real story  but theyre fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts  its fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this  but that doesnt excuse the fact that it is  indeed  awful  ,0,0
244,starring arnold schwarzenegger  danny devito  emma thompson  frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment  and a big one at that  junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman  these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins  so foolish me  i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins  so much for hopes  schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists  doctors hesse and arbogast  who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy  unfortunately  due to circumstances beyond their control  they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans  and subsequently lose their funding  still believing that their drug will work  they decide to test it anyway  on hesse  so  dr  hesse  schwarzenegger  artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug  their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying  surely it will work on a woman  does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you  well  it must have to the producers of junior  admittedly  schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off  perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny  but it wasnt  schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best  the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy  and the accompanying emotional swings  is not funny  schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics  i kept thinking to myself  with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture  better yet  with schwarzenegger  devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time  why didnt they make a sequel to twins  anything would have been better than this mess  danny devito is wasted in this movie  his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street    after seeing the movie  if i was devito  i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street   emma thompson is wasted here as well  while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations  she is also a fine comedian  too bad she didnt get to use any of that talent here  am i being too hard on this film  i dont think so  schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today  and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood  with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella  the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film  they certainly managed here  maybe it was well intentioned  but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made  if you are tempted to see this film  do yourself a favor and go rent twins  a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devitos comedic talents  ,0,0
245,who would have thought  jim carrey does drama  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show  i thought   what a hilarious idea for a movie   however  it was an even better premise for a drama  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man  that man is truman burbank  jim carrey   truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly  cristof wants to keep it that way  christof is the  god  of this madeup world  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world  but they failed and life went on as normal  the opening parts of the film introduce to trumans world  we see what he is doing at his current age  then we get a flashback at his past  it may seem a tad boring  but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start  the film can be described in one word  weird  it seems like such a simple idea  yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of  but andrew niccol did  it seems like a warped idea  but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype  the hype  whether good or bad  always focused on carreys ability to do drama  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be  the only thing they doubted was carrey  and he showed them all up  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars  i do not think he was the best actor  but he deserved the nomination  he plays truman burbank  the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years  but then strange things start happening  he ventures into the wrong elevator  a light crashes in front of him  his father comes back and is then pulled away  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show  but truman does not  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point  peter weir does not make the cast perfect  and their flaws eventually lead to trumans escape  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down  despite carreys greatness  the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris  who plays the  god  of trumans world  he displays the pressure he is under  the world he has created  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life  the action moves at a good pace  and rarely gets sluggish  but  the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  it really makes you think  maybe your brother is an actor  maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for trumans arrival  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon  noah emmerich  delivers his dramatic line  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative  i was not only enjoying the film  i was overwhelmed by genius of it  overall  the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces  but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film  ,1,1
246,apocalypse now  based on the novel  hearts of darkness   is an extremely striking  gripping  and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle  a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an antiwar film  in many ways  this debate could go either way  apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made  in addition  now film has gone to the extremes that this film does  a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years  apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l  willard  played by martin sheen  to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e  kurtz  a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia  captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with  extreme prejudice  because he has been deemed a murderer  willard accepts his mission  but not while pondering the accusation  accusing someone of murder in this situation is like  handing out speeding tickets at the indy    as he puts it  it doesnt make too much sense  escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat  the men are chef  frederic forrest   chief  albert hall   lance johnson  sam bottoms  and mr  clean  a fifteen yearold laurence fishburne   willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is  but they all know it is something big  the men encounter many exciting  dangerous and bizarre situations  but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore  kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf  surf  this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson  duvalls portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific  and  he provides a number of memorable quotes  eventually  captain willard encounters colonel kurtzs frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look  especially his followers  one of his main followers is a freelance photographer  dennis hopper  who attempts to convey the situations to willard  but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony  kurtz is actually well aware of willards mission  and refers to him as  an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill   yet willard is intent on completing his mission  no matter what shocking things kurtz does  apocalypse now  possibly one of the greatest films ever made  is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war  a movie that will hypnotize you with its brilliant cinematography  apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war  definitely on the  do not miss  list  be prepared for a very memorable film  ,1,1
247,with his successful books and movies  michael crichton is doing well  with early successes with westworld    and coma     and recent films such as jurassic park     his films have been entertaining  however  he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere  this  million mess by good director barry levison  disclosure  is dull  long winded  and a huge disappointment  considering the huge budget  the all star cast  and a story by crichton  sphere is majorly disappointing  the film opens with norman goodman  hoffman   a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors  however  when he arrives  he his told by supervisor barnes  peter coyote  that he is actually investigating an spacecraft  along with goodman is mathematician harry adams  jackson   biologist beth halperin  stone  and ted fielding  liev schrieber   they investigate the spaceship  find a massive sphere inside  meet an alien intelligence called jerry  and basically weird crap happens  unfortunately  something went wrong along the way with sphere  the film starts off entertaining enough  but throughout this very long movie  it just gets sillier and sillier  the film jaunts along from scene to scene  never fully explaining what is going on  the actors and directing dont help  either  hoffman is on autopilot  and almost seems embarrassed  throughout the movie  churning out dull lines  and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie  stone is useless  displaying no emotion  and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman  the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson  whos funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere  but hes hardly in it  and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone  the same goes for peter coyote  who hams it up as the officer  but is then killed off halfway through  the director  barry levinson  who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure    messes up with the drama and the action  the drama scenes are  quite frankly  boring  and the action scenes suffer from overkill  with levison throwing the camera all over the place  much like the godawful speed     the writing doesnt help much  either  although crichton is great with plots  hes terrible with dialogue  and practically every line in sphere is a dud  the speech is too simple  i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent  practically every line is just stating the obvious  none of it is smart  also  where the hell did the budget go  the sphere itself is impressive  and theres a few nice special effect shots  but where the  million went is anyones guess  theres a giant squid attack in the picture  but not once does the audience see the squid  even though the film has a massive budget  i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid  and if handled correctly it probably would  but the whole scene is done badly  and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid  finally  the film has no idea what genre to be  levison cant handle his own plot  it leaps from hokey scifi  to horror  and finally the shiningevent horizon psychological thriller  and  of course  the film is very much like the abyss     although in its defense  crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released  and is far superior to this rubbish   its not all that bad though  the plot is all right  theres a few jump scenes  although nothing very scary  and theres the occasionally interesting bit  but overall  sphere is a big waste of some fine talent  a lot of money  and a potentially good movie  not really worth seeing  overall rating review by david wilcock ,0,0
248,clue is an unfairly ignored comedy  very similar to s murder by death  this big screen version of the classic board game  whats next    chutes and ladders  the motion picture   is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue  the plot  for what its worth  has all the characters from the game  in this case  the names from the game are used as aliases  meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr  boddy  lee ving   the man whos been blackmailing them all  when he turns up dead  everyone  including the audience  must figure out whodunnit    and in what room  and with what object  while not as witty as neil simons murder by death  clue definitely has it moments  it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when im joking around with my friends  to this day  whenever someone says the phrase  well  to make a long story short  i have the follow up phrase  too late  ready to go  the cast  all very good comedic talents  play well off one another  while the late madeline kahn  as the dark and sultry mrs  white  sometimes steals the film away from the rest  and colleen camp  as the french maid yvette  displays some of her natural talents as well  clue is available on dvd from paramount home video  it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of       and is enhanced for x televisions  and features the original theatrical trailer  a french language audio track is also available  the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not  and it even includes a scene not in the film itself  a scene that should have been in the film  as its a good joke   also  the trailer is scored to the music from airplane   which was an interesting choice  when clue played in theaters  it ran with the gimmick of three different endings  if you wanted to see all three  you had to go to the movies three separate times  so when the film was released on home video  rather than releasing three separate videos  all three endings were included on one tape    the first two endings being  what if   endings and the third ending being the actual ending  now for the dvd release you get two choices  you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you    note  theres an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this  after watching the film with a randomly selected ending  when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it  when you do  a secret menu opens  allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves   now while i applaud the effort of paramount here  as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc  it just doesnt work well  first  why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch  maybe someone like myself whos seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only  im no technical dvd expert  but i cant imagine that being too hard to accomplish  secondly  the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious  thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely dont need a distraction  finally  the back of the dvd case states  and now  with this special dvd version  you can see all  surprise endings   i have no idea why they would word it that way  since thats not a special feature in the slightest  the video has been out for fifteen years now  good lord  has it been that long   and its played on television with all three endings all the time  these are merely minor complaints however  seeing that ive watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd  the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy  and im thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format  pg ,1,1
249,mm  written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker  has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles  who is asked by upper class toff mrs  christian  myra carter  to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe  the movie happens to be an mythical snuff movie  where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed  all mrs  christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not  welles agrees  and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies  with video clerk max california  phoenix  as his guide  although the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema  mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing  although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away  mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much  and apart from a few moments  most of the action in the film is nothing you havent seen from another standard thriller  the cast help towards the entertainment  apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona     ever since leaving las vegas     cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  such as in the terrible snake eyes     here  in mm  hes boring  uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice  and in this overlong thriller  these virtues do not help keep the suspense up  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving  as phoenix is a true talent  his performance is a great break away from the gloom  and hes just purely enjoyable to watch  catherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife  although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves  her character  though  is hugely underwritten  one of the most wasted characters of the year  also fun is fargos peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director  as this film is written by the person behind seven  mm is filled with doom and gloom  and noone appears to know how to use an light switch  unlike seven  mm isnt too clever  and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives  lacking the strong characters seven featured  mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise  and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment  but director joel schumacher  the completely wrong guy for the job  puts style over content  and while the direction and look are good  its just not very disturbing  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience  and though we are meant to be looking at the dark belly of the porn industry  it doesnt exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind  which misses the point  also  the last  minutes are so hackneyed  so cliched  its amazing to think its the same film youre watching  mm is far from an success  a snuffed opportunity  with a boring lead character  controversial scenes that manage not to be controversial  and a director obsessed with looks  what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller  ultimately  mm is probably worth renting on home video  unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like  and trust me  the rest of the  hours are not worth it  ,0,1
250,its a good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan  because  titan a  e   is proof that hollywood doesnt have a clue how to do it  i dont know what this film is supposed to be about  from what i can tell its about a young man named kale whos one of the last survivors of earth in the early st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and regenerating what is left of the human race  thats a fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie  but theres no payoff  the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil  dredge  aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason  so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights  fistfights  blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake a stick at  theres so much pointless scifi banter its too much to take  the galaxy here is a total ripoff of the  star wars  universe the creators dont bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing  the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring  despite the fantastic animation and special effects  its just not an interesting movie  ,0,0
251,director luis mandokis last film was the superb  serious  drama  when a man loves a woman   but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture   message in a bottle   which is the worst type of romance  a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense  and the film ultimately moves at such a very  very deliberate pace  as if it is trying to make great   meaningful  statements and plot developments  that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through    message in a bottle  begins with theresa osborne  robin wright penn   a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune  whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day  inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine  and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and  to her objection  finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper  soon  a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message  and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake  theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks  a boating town in north carolina  to find out the specifics of the message  of course  garrett turns out to be a handsome  rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner  she is immediately charmed by him  but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there  and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier  do you think you know where this is headed  most likely you do  and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end  the movie has fallen into deep  artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second  if there are any positive things to say about  message in a bottle   it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman  as garretts stubborn  but loving father  are far above par to be in such a wasteful   shaggy dog  love story  and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast  and paints chicago as an equally alluring city  meanwhile  costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently  it seems that with such bad luck  he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water  but here he is again with one of the main  and most ridiculous  centerpieces set on a stormswept sea  the other actors are all  sadly  wasted  including illeana douglas  an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the  friend  roles  here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune  the first half of  message in a bottle  plays like a humdrum  trite television movie for the lifetime channel  as theresa spends a great deal of time  getting to know  garrett  with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining  usually  i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships  but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt  written   and not as if people were really  talking   when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other  and are not particularly interesting themselves  you know immediately that you are in trouble  i swear that while watching  message in a bottle   i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater  heck  in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on  by nicholas sparks   always one step ahead of the characters  the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama  the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing  nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret  and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after  this same exact problem occurred in last years very  very similar  watch this  and you will realize just how similar i mean  meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama   city of angels   although theresa is deeply touched by the  heartfelt  letter that she finds in the bottle  perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own  preferably before filming began  it should have read   memo to screenwriters  use you brain   ,0,1
252,even if i did not know that director and cowriters james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the xfiles  i would have inevitably made a connection  the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon like plot  to the mysterious characters  to the overall dark  ominous settings  it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case  they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis  in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie   another more important similarity  is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time  this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie  especially when compared to some of the trash  of the same genre  released in the last couple of years  urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch   what helps final destination is its unique premise  unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders  the villain presented is unusual  its the grim reaper  this being already has predestined when and how you will die  according to the brief history lesson given in this film  everyone was meant to die at a certain time  some people at   others at   whatever death chooses  what is unique about death is that its already dead  so you cant really kill it  the only way to defeat death is to cheat it  the question is how do you do that  this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers  alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash  leaving no survivors  alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off  shortly after  the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal  however  death isnt through with them yet  it gradually kills off the seven one by one  leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again  the plot allows for some of the most creative  original death scenes i have seen in a while  some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax  others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock  creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films  sure  it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders  ali larters character is particularly annoying   but the shocks  from the beginning to the end  are extremely entertaining  also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously  he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that wont win any academy awards  not even a golden globe   the myriad of inside jokes and gags  the characters are named after famous horror directors  one character who plays a jerk is named carter  like xfiles creator chris carter  and a song by john denver  who died in a plane crash  plays whenever death is near  show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie  and from this  i had a great time watching the movie  ,1,1
253,did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion  that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward  with a comatose sunny von bulow  she is the main narrator of the film  in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder  the dramatic trick works  as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder  sex  unhappiness  and a lawyers moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win  jeremy irons is claus von bulow  in what is his finest role  and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history  he is as hated as any man alive  as cold as a cucumber  his remorse for his wifes comatose condition is nonexistant  and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas    the background to the case is such  during christmas of   sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke  the same situation occured in   only sunny never woke  and probably never will  when examined  it was found that she had  times the normal amount of insulin within her blood  claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson  convicted  and freed on bail  he immediately hires alan dershowitz  the renowed harvard law professor  to acquit him  ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him  we follow him through two very different cases  the case of the johnson case  where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didnt commit  and von bulow  who he still hasnt figured out  dershowitz doesnt know what happened to sunny  and he is extremely hesitant to take the case  nevertheless  he does  based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him  together with a group of law students  dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed  silvers performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film  schroeder directs on many different levels  with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz  there are flaws  at times  the film gets overly theatrical  yet  due to glenn closes troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow  the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well  the flashbacks are good  but at times schroeder doesnt fill in the blanks  the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film  and it could have used a better ending  the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly  without any intelligent conclusion  the supporting characters are often neglected  and dershowitzs team should have been allowed to grow character wise  but schroeder oversimplifies the story and the characters  yet  for all these flaws  the film is deeply engrossing because of irons  as von bulow  he is brutally evil  antisemitic  prejudiced  arrogant  protective  he is a rotten  lying monster  whose conviction may have been wrong legally  but morally he was to blame  irons plays him to a cold perfection  with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence  he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder  however  the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility  there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wifes death by years of neglect and coldness  however  legally  did he do the murder  schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind  with all the character flaws  reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent  he wants the viewer to make up his own mind  schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations  and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow  in death  for all the failed dramatic theatrics  this is one that works beautifully  we dont know what happened  that sense of legal ambiguousness  along with von bulows obvious moral guilt  is why reversalf fortune works  in the end  von bulow is as sadistic as ever  irons is haunting  and that is why reversal of fortune is so good  ,1,1
254,us critictype people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies arent thrill rides  but i think that  back to the future ii  is one of the few exceptions  if the original film had the spirit of the s  then this has the spirit of the s  full of fights  chase scenes  cliff hangers  special effects  some detective work  and of course the vision of the hightech future  the film picks up exactly where the first film left off  with doc  lloyd   marty  fox   and jennifer  elizabeth shue  travelling  years into the future  because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifers kids  doc tells marty he must take his sons place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr  says yes to griff  wilson  in one of four different roles   whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasnt joking  especially when it comes to the movies  essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the s takes place again in the year   but its not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself  at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better  and it seems like everythings copasetic right  wrong  since when do things go according to plan in the  back to the future  movies  there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i wont even bother to list them all  basically we get to see marty as an old man  his house  his family  etc  we also go back to an alternate   and then back again to   with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath  the films best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle  its difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail  the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense  instead of a grand finale  we get lots of little victories  by the end everything is back to normal  but something happens that leads to yet another sequel  but it doesnt seem gratuitous    back to the future part ii  is a really great adventure movie  it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor  ,1,1
255,  note  there are spoilers regarding the films climax  the election  of course  we see matthew broderick  a man torn to a primal state  hes been unfaithful to his wife  lied to and manipulated his students  and by the same token theyve demeaned his masculinity  his selfrespect  his desperate attempt at changing the world  and yet  he equates the cause of his pain  his torment  with tracy flick  reese witherspoon   no matter how many students have come and gone  and disappointed him as an educator  shes the real threat  about to give in  and divulge that shes won by only a lone vote  brodericks mccalister turns in defeat  sees tracys euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says  no  the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men  no matter how obscure  have in their relationships  a traditional expectation of success  to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry  she cant go higher than him  he wont allow it  and whats amazing about  election  is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor  early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically  and then sexually  involved with a now departed teacher  its like payne and taylor  his coscreenwriter  have taken tracy  a girl desperate for friendship  loyalty  and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers  that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting  to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist  and its amazing the compassion that we have  it seems so real to us  and not merely because its happened before  splashed all over the front pages  but  because of the all around  nice  persona of these people  we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters  its with mandy barnetts  if youll be the teacher  playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most  a final  viscous injection of bittersweet irony  sexuality  though  is not the only basis for paynes satire  or its success  it also makes a telling point about politics  friendship  and class boundaries  satire is required  or ought to be  anyway  to take itself seriously  or act so  while the audience does not  its a fine line to straddle  but some films ignore it altogether   drop dead gorgeous  leaps infuriatingly to mind   payne and taylor hit the right chord  their characters are real people  neither is perfect  but rather both of the leads are flawed  misguided individuals who retain  somewhat  noble intentions at heart  we sympathize with them  but still  as a satire  their idiosyncratic behavior  and their wrongdoing  is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle  but also reflect and meditate  about  minus half a point  though  for payne admitting not to having seen  ferris buellers day off   whatever  ,1,1
256,  seven  is one of the best mystery movies ive ever seen  its extremely intriguing and suspenseful  but its also quite fun  its a serial killer mystery  but you dont care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer  the story is a copsonthetrailofserialkiller mystery  someone is murdering people who are offenders of  the seven deadly sins   a fat man  gluttony  was forced to eat himself to death  a lawyer  greed  is slaughtered by his own rich possessions    i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much  what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the  good guys  which makes the unseen villain seem so vile  brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills  the cocky rookie  however  morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset  the wise veteran on the verge of retirement  and he doesnt get killed by the end   there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief  this is impressive because the mood is so tense  and the fact that it can be downplayed as well as it is here  let alone at all  is quite an accomplishment  the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil  scary place many believe it to be  the production design is superb  in the spirit of  batman  and  the crow   this film embodies the gothic mood  the way the words fade in and out  along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level  even the credits are scary  the killers victims have no connections at all  and thus mills and sommerset dont have much to go on to solve the case  they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense  we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown  not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this  the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect  lets just say it seems a little too  mystery movie   or too convenient in other words  when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe  a terrific chase scene ensues  this is a typical thrilling element  but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story  if anything  this film is the epitome of twist endings  i dont have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal  but the way in which this happens is surprising  there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives  and even though hes obviously insane  his charisma makes for some good points  whats even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the films resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is    seven  is not just a film about crime  but about the evil within man  john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of  scum   but as justified as he makes himself seem  we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice  ,1,1

258,my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance  or a movie that weve all seen a million times   two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins  this is exactly what happened in this movie  but fortunately  they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way  the movie starts with a quick  and i do mean quick  glance of two presidents russell kramer  jack lemmon  and matt douglas  james garner   william haney  dan aykroyd  and ted matthews  john heard  are the new president and vice president  there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago  he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead  this movie was exceptional for many reasons  one being that they found people  lemmon and garner  that have good chemisty together  they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly  one being a ladies man and one being the old man  ill let you fiqure which is which   also  they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well  it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman  except then he was a congressman   experience counts for a lot   ,1,1
259,die hard  is an altogether unfortunate fiasco  inferior to the original in every respect  place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson  who wrote the films pathetic screenplay  every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor  the plot is altogether implausible  the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower  leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land  the film has zero credibility  and all of the characters come off as cliched  cardboard cutouts  so much for the script  how about the action  well  lets put it this way  director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan  who directed the original  as well as the hunt for red october and predatorall standouts for their hairraising suspense  by contrast  harlin doesnt have a clue when it comes to choreographing action  and consequently  die hard  never picks up steam  die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute  in fact  the movie often seems deliberately campy  and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad its good  you do laugh  but you laugh at the film  not with it  die hard  should have never been cleared for takeoff  ,0,0
260,maybe the most important thing about this movie is that its not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month  because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker  broadcasted on abc on a monday night  starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth  respectively  because its not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why its so great  underneath the todiefor cinematography  the brilliant acting  and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty  not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it  tell it in a certain original way  it doesnt merely go from plot point to plot point  it goes from character to character  it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all  and makes the story of a worldreknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters  both musicians  who have a totally unique relationship  its that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball  shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this  unlike  patch adams   effortlessly emotional and real  in short  this movie is just awesome  it merely tells its story really well  and thats something that just has to be commended these days  when most stories are botched because theyre not told by great storytellers  director anand tucker tells this story well  he overdramaticizes everything  but still keeps it real  the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr   rachel griffiths and emily watson  respectively   two sisters who are first seen in childhood  played by auriol evans and keely flanders  respectively  as the very best of friends  they are also both musicians  hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist  and when it all begins  both are considered child prodigies  but hilary is seen as the better of the two  jackie  a bit jealous  works and works at her playing skills  and soon the tables are turned  when they both hit adulthood  hilary strives for a comeback  while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world  but instead of fame  captures the heart of a hapless  joyful conductor  kiffer finzi  david morissey  in a semistarmaking turn   they marry  after a short courtship  and move to a lovely country house  making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life  when she plays  she has the eyes of the world  but when she stops  shes alone  she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist  daniel barenboim  james frain   in hopes that she may overcloud her sister  but she eventually begins to lose it  and runs away to hilarys country home  where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband  since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure  its all terribly melodramtic  as you can see  and by the time jackie has contracted ms  in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semismiliar  shine  in technical and emotional devastation   it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadnt been handled in such a way  the key thing here is that its not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that its about her tumultuous relationship with her sister  which  i might add  is perfectly realized  their relationship is the most downtoearth complex entity of the year  they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world  but theyre also completely jealous of one another  when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities  she tries in vain to make a comeback but cant  and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success  when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man  she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that ive ever seen in a film  only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man   and the whole time  their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  another thing i really liked is emily watsons performance  i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease  or any combination of the three   my reasoning for this is that its a fucking easy job  the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in  beloved   sure  shes good  but whats so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around  slurs her words together  and acts like a three year old inside a year olds body  hell  i could play that if i had a pair of breasts  in that same exact movie  though  is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane  her brothers run off never to be seen again  and her mothers lover is scared off  she has to actually deal with real emotions  something much harder than mere stumbling about  but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons  if you dont believe me  look at jack nicholsons performance in  as good as it gets   great performance  but easy job  this isnt so for watson  though  because her insanity comes from real emotions  not just a plot point  and thanks to the opening sequence  where we see her and hilary as kids  we understand the motives behind all her actions  and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life  weve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses  rachel griffiths  who would have otherwise been the understudy to watsons protagonist  actually matches watson stepforstep  because as watson grows insane  and demands unspeakable things from her  griffiths holds her own  and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her  griffiths  an otherwise unknown actress  and watson being famous from  breaking the waves  and  the boxer    is absolutely brilliant  just as absolutely brilliant as watson is  and if the academy and all the other critics groups  whove already deemed watsons performance the best of the year  glance over hers because shes the one who doesnt get to go insane  read  she gets the boring role   then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me  after all  griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real  the tom cruise role in  rainman   the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman   she does  and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year  its griffiths  together  the two actresses work extremely well  though  and both have to go through deep emotional hell  the likes of which havent been seen this year  if it hadnt been for an otherwise nottotallygreat final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary  when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety   id say this is one of the top ten best films of the year  its so close to perfection  in its structure  its treatment of its subject  and its beautiful technical specifications  cinematography nomination  without a shred of doubt in my mind  and maybe film editing   that its nearly a shame that its not the flawless gem that it should be  but  hey  as it is  i can hardly complain  ,1,1
261,i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool  i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage  grousing to myself about its transparently planes  trains and automobiles plot machinations  and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement  this was a mass market romantic comedy  after all  a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and  even in its best days  worked hard to perpetuate the romance  infatuation paradigm  then marc lawrence did something wonderful  something which made the entire film click into place  he showed me a comic love story about grownups  it certainly didnt look that way from the outset  which introduces groomtobe ben holmes  ben affleck  at his bachelor party  surrounded by friends and family whooping over his  last night of freedom   ben loves his fiancee bridget  maura tierney   but the doomandgloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this till death do you part business  then  on an illfated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah  ben meets sarah lewis  sandra bullock   a freespirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her  as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn  ben and sarah begin a threeday southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger  ben seeing in sarah the chances hes never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability shes never had  forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start  setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue  ben is an ideal role for afflecks easygoing charm  and he plays the straightlaced straight man without forced exasperation  sandra bullock  for her part  is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last halfdozen films combined  avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping  the two performances  part of a great toptobottom cast  are effective and connected from the start  yet the scripts apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely  lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis  forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like selfjustification  the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose  leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution  forces of nature isnt about a man developing a fear of commitment  its about a man learning what commitment means to him  learning that its not what he thought it was  lawrences script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending  an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense  earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance  and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine  though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film  and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples  forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that youll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom  that is  provided youre not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes  for a brisk romantic comedy  forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most overdirected scenes of the year  teetering handheld shots  whynot low or high angles  sweeping pans  occasionally the hyperreal approach works  with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance  far more often  hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is  covering it with flourishes so thick you almost cant find whats underneath  a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director  but even hughes excesses cant spoil this unique concoction  forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant  something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents  ,1,1
262,why do so many childrens films treat their target audience with utter contempt  too many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just cant handle serious  thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues    the iron giant   which was directed and cowritten by brad bird  late of such animated series as  the simpsons  and  king of the hill   assumes that not only can children handle such discussions  but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time    the iron giant  holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience  making it a film thats enjoyable for both children and adults alike  hogarth hughes  voice of eli marienthal  is a spirited young lad who lives with his hardworking single mother  annie  jennifer aniston   in a small town in maine  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away  hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception  he comes across a giant robot  vin diesel  from space that eats metal for food  after saving the robot  nicknamed the iron giant  from electric shock  hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts  because of damage he suffered upon landing  the giant has forgotten what his original mission was  so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy  realizing he cant just keep the giant in a barn all the time  and that the giant needs food  he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean  harry connick jr    an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth cant keep the giant a secret forever  because a government spook named kent mansley  christopher mcdonald  has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant  and takes up residence in hogarths house as a lodger  meanwhile  the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind    the iron giant  is exactly what family films ought to be  because it doesn t talk down to its audience  the story is simple  very simple  about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy  its very similar to the spielberg classic  e  t    and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of  the iron giant   the film holds many of the better elements of spielbergs film  such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy  the film delivers several serious messages  the most important of which is ones ability to choose ones own fate  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be  a hero  the final sequence is touching and appropriate  though i wont give it away  i will say that very few will be disappointed  the animation  while not up to disney standards  what could be  after  tarzan     is good enough to make you forget youre watching a cartoon  the giant is computeranimated  while the human characters are all handdrawn the oldfashioned way  the characters faces are done quite well  drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible  but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth  and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother  harry connick jr  does a nice characterization as dean  and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney  of tvs  frasier   as an army general called in by agent mansley  unlike several cartoon features  each character is actually a developed personality  rather than a stereotype  and is actually integral to the plot  rather than being a superfluous comicrelief sidekick  a clich  disney still hasnt ditched   dean  for example  could have been a stereotypical beatnik  his character profile seems to suggest that   but he is presented as a character with real emotions  thoughts  and motivations  even the heavy  agent mansley  is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to  but out of his own fear and paranoia  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paperthin stereotypes and figure the kids wont mind  but  the iron giant  has clearly put a little work into making the characters real  and it pays off  the film isnt only around to deliver heavyhanded messages  though  its also very funny  and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things  such as dive into a pool  are handled well  and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing  having worked on  the simpsons  for many years  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to  outlast  one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed  and also extremely clever  the film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war  satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to  duck and cover  in the event of a nuclear attack    the iron giant  has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films  and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head  we get welltimed  clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with  when you get right down to it   the iron giant  is no more than the story of a boy and his robot  the story is so straightforward  so quaint  that it ultimately becomes charming  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person  when it comes to family entertainment  simple is the way to go  its akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word  but its not the story that sets the film above others of its kind  but rather the elements that go into the story  namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue  which  the iron giant  has in spades  ,1,1
263,errol morris  critically acclaimed director of the  documentary fast  cheap and out of control  vaults to new heights with mr  death  this film  an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a  leuchter  jr   is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise  stunning even the more jaded minds among us  dont let the films cheesy dissuade you  following this sideshow of horrorlab special effects we are plunged quickly into a nonstop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchters life and mind  morris follows the trail of leuchters madness with appalling lucidity  revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with  this leuchter guy is seriously messed up  virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls  leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession  designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries  in spite of his lack of credentials  after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows  leuchter came to the attention of neonazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel  who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his theory that the holocaust never happened  morriss interviews are surprisingly congenial  drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves  zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch  leuchter seems completely at ease  sometimes jovial  part of this effect may be due to morriss new interviewing machine  called the interrotron  which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer  this was the first time morris had used the device  and the results are startling  combine the irony of these interviews with leuchters reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau  not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant  and youve got one compelling and disturbing documentary  while this film isnt for the feebleminded or weakhearted  it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape  aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece  morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i  for one  feel bettered by the experience  ,1,1
264,a big surprise to me  the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off  but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues  john belushi  is such a dumb idea i really had no hope  they replaced him just fine  not with john goodman  he didnt do much of anything  but with the brilliant actor joe morton  who can really sing  the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant  whos ten  this was another of my fears for the film  but hes a really good dancer  and plays a mean harmonica  although he may have been dubbed   things that intellectually had bothered me before  like no mission from god  everyone being richer  it not being filmed in chicago  gave me no problems at all  im quite pleased that there were less car pileups  because they meant less music  and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing  theres a few early crashes  and then one huge pileup  but after that it all stops  its just the music  one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him  but theres no problems with this  the music is all as good as ever  tons of great musicians showing up  with the exception of johnny lang  who cant sing  all the musicians do a great job  the only real problems i had was the special effects  these were superfluous and a waste of money  since the film isnt doing very well  they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel  which i want to see  the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide   http  www  geocities  comhollywoodacademy remove no spam to reply    drive carefully but recklessly   mama  childs toy  the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise   peter otoole ,1,0
265,in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer  professor with such livedin naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance  ever since wall street  douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mids  in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen  with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world  youd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a goodnatured veneer  but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton  douglas played the role straight and out in the open  in wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force  its simple yet truthful  he embodies grady  a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes  grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map  when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop  we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms  grady points out  in his narration  that they only do so out of jealousy  their target is the very writerly named james leer  played by the always understated tobey maguire   a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for  leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions  he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges  hes portentous and gloomy  as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers  though his act is a little too calculated  he reminds me of the selfimposed outcast film director  jim jarmusch  dead man  ghost dog   whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner  the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer   exclusively dressed in black  and with his spiked hair dyed snow white  leer is similar  a guy who equates quirks with depth  tobey maguire fits well in the role  with his round  sweeteerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude  but unlike cort  maguire is easier to warm up to  hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility  katie holmes plays hannah  a beautiful  talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants  this is a plot line i had trouble with  douglas  in his old age  is beginning to resemble jerry springer  a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions  at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady  maybe its because im jealous  and wish holmes was throwing herself at me  after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth   then i think of douglass real life companion  the breathtaking catherine zeta jones  seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping  suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand  that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie  and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas  there is a movie in there somewhere  grady  rather chivalrously if you ask me  resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell  a droll frances mcdormand   who is his age  but also married to another professor  okay  maybe not so chivalrous  there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says   she was a junkie for the printed word  lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice   robert downy j  r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm  downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual  hes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance  the actor is perfectly cast here  and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor  i wish wonder boys had more of him  searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless  for it meanders through its running time  but thats part of its charm  and maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia  a place im greatly fond of  and a place rarely explored in american cinema  everyone has a subgenre  be it war films  westerns  dance movies  that they happen to be privy to  im privy to films about literary types i  e  those individuals enthralled by the written word  and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch  the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters  rather than generic mapped out story points  sometimes the dialogue is too clever  but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often  another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted  like its characters  but as the story progresses it begins to open up  for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types  and as a lowkey comedy for its chuckleworthy throwaway gags  the gags are like those in the great robert altman  m  a  s  h  the long goodbye  movies  where jokes exist as asides on the fringes  like jokes in life often do  the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog  and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things  curtis hanson  who before his last film  la confidential  toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it  an early tom cruise sex comedy  and the hand the rocks the cradle  has graduated to more meaningful films  he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style  the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up  the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party  but in a wonder boys party  it fits  the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen  its the cinematic equivalent to a good read  novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies  many will find it slight  but i found much to savor among its subtleties  ,1,1
266,disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life  richard  leonardo dicaprio  sets off for thailand  there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy  robert carlyle  who gives him a map to a beach  a secret utopia  then commits suicide  richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel   tienne  guillaume canet  and fran  oise  virginie ledoyen   once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach  there richard falls for fran  oise  this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element  which is solely a creation of hollywood  seems to hold to the original novel  the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking  i dont think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning  but that is were many things go wrong  darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography  though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking  the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts  this is where the movie has some great potential  then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better  yes folks i said better  now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good  nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise  this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost unwatchable  there is even a video game style sequence that borders on the disgusting  it doesnt make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion  and i am hoping many other peoples   i am hoping that in my little rant ive made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing  so if you go see it and you dont like it because of this dont blame me  the character development was not up to par either  i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child  although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard  leos character  comes off as a wannabe philosopher  the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason  granted some people are like this  myself included  but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does  the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough  richard is obviously obsessed by fran  oise at the early stages of the story  yet there is actually very little development along this story line  this i am sure contributes to the movies lack of core plot and being unfocused  now  i shall move onto something a little better about the movie  for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it   the cast and acting was passable at the very least  and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard  mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better  which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much    i think this is a topic all on its own so i wont get into it   but i like the fact that there was an international cast used  had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible  the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable  not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense  when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable  i would not recommend this movie to anyone  the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story  as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt  if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings  ,0,0

269,let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film  i really wasnt looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films  im not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the everpresent dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years  im happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first  minutes of the film  by that point  it was evident that mr  bond was back with a vengeance  all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film werent exactly a pleasant experience  it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts  it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in  i guess they can be excused though  taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain  anyway  after somebody remembered what the light switch was for  i settled in for bond  i think the most noticeable aspect of this  the th film in the series  is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films  there were probably more oneliners in this movie than in the last several combined  and bonds last oneliner in the film is about the best of the series  the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series  everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for   for the most part  the action sequences worked very well  although  there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top  even for a bond film  i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted  while he did a good job for the most part  there were points in the movie  specifically during action sequences  that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film  most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie  he almost seemed like he didnt know what he was doing  but they were brief scenes and really shouldnt take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  if you have ever seen a bond film  you wont be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit  the world is not enough is no exception  this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world   matches wits with the terrorist renard  robert carlyle   a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain  why this point is included is beyond me  they took great pains to explain his condition  but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought  anyway  renard  like the typical terrorist that he is  is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mideast oil pipeline  i guess world domination just isnt as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore  bond is brought in to protect the pipelines owner  elektra king  sophie marceau   who is the daughter of one of renards recent victims  along the way  bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist  dr  christmas jones  denise richards   and his old rival valentin zukovsky  robert carlyle   like all bond films  you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot  since it is ridiculous beyond words  my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films  there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing  the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceaus character  it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly  although not included in the film  later  it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something  but because it is a bond film  the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly  after all  it isnt shakespeare  how about the cast  brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as   i grew up with the roger moore version of bond  so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character  judi dench  as m  had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role  she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner  robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye  so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie  coltrane gets more screen time  which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes  then there are the bond girls  sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today  there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim  those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face  marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest  then we have denise richards  there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks  and after you see the outfits she wears  you wont have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producers eyes  i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist  admittedly  there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue  but other than that she stacks up  no pun intended  to her bond girl predecessors nicely  i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyles character  while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had  his character just never worked for me  the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character  but it just never quite got off the ground  i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character  but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character  this might have worked well in another movie  but i dont go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations  last  but not least  we have desmond llewelyn as q  this is the th appearance for llewelyn as bonds gadget guy  and he is as good as ever  although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films  he is still a treat to watch  rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role  he says future appearances are up to a higher power  the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement  a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese  while we dont see much of him in this film  i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyns legacy  whenever it is passed on  will be in very capable hands  so how does it stack up  despite some problems  the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie  and  all things considered  what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies  this is easily the best of the brosnan films  it may even be the best of the entire series  certainly in the top   one thing is for sure  even after  movies  there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series  heres looking forward to bond number   ,1,0
270,originally entitled dancing about architecture  i  e    talking about love is like dancing about architecture    but changed because it sounded too much like the recent boxoffice dud dancing at lughnasa  this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names  playing interesting and wellwritten characters  within a vignettesstyled plot arrangement a la robert altman  plot  follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love  finding themselves  regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are  and who they want  and appreciating the fine emotional art of love  critique  charmingly effective romantic drama  this film offers insight into various types of relationships  presents us with interesting characters and excellent performances from the cast  and scratches beneath the surface of love and its many complex subtleties  how do people fall in love  why do people fall out of love  how do people fall back into love  once theyve been hurt and left to join the lonely hearts club  all of these questions and more  are touched upon in this film  within several types of variant relationships  meet a hip  young couple going through their first date  a divorcee attempting to date again after her many failed relationships  a married woman  finding herself  while cheating on her husband  a husband letting go of his inhibitions  an older couple dealing with a past  love  of the man  a secret recently uncovered  a son dying from aids  joined by his mother at the hospital  there are many nuances to this picture  and many ideas and quotes to which we could all relate  but more importantly  there is diversity  diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy this film on many levels  some related to the younger couples issues  others with the married  theres a little bit of everything for everyone in here  and i would bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch this film again in a year  i would relate myself to yet another predicament  just like love itself  this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different levels  the actors in this film are all also very  very good  sean connery is solid as the older man with some issues to resolve  as is gena rowlands  as the aging wife with trepidations  jolie comes out of this film a star with a great performance  while philippe is as prettyboy as ever  anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to reignite her love life  opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by former talkshow host  jon stewart  even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film  and offers a convincing show of a man lost within his own imagination  the only piece of this puzzle which left me somewhat detached  was the part surrounding jay mohr  the man dying from aids  and his mother  ellen burstyn  the actors were fine  but somehow  the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else  the ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me  but i guess thats just hollywood  this film is actually a lot like your friends and neigbors      and happiness      in concept and style  but its complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness  the characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care  as opposed to this film  which offers rich and believable characters  living real lives and talking about real issues in todays relationships  all in all  this movie offers many interesting characters  talking and living genuine and engaging love lives  wonderful performances by its solid cast  too sweet of an ending  but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie nonetheless  little known facts about this film and its stars  according to a story in the london sunday mirror  sean connery asked for only    for his role in this movie  as compared to his usual fee of  million  because he liked the script so much  on top of that  he convinced his costars  including gena rowlands  gillian anderson  ellen burstyn  et al   to do the same  this is directorwriter willard carroll second real foray into the world of  adult films   before this  he had written and produced many childrens movies  gillian anderson stands   angelina jolies full name is angelina jolie voight  she is actor jon voights daughter  she has trained and performed at the lee strasberg theatre institute  she divorced actor jonny lee miller of trainspotting      fame in   they were married in   actor ryan phillippes full name is matthew ryan phillippe  he stands   and spent his childhood in new castle  delaware  his acting career started on tvs  one life to live   he portrayed daytime televisions first gay teenager  jon stewarts full name is jonathan stewart leibowitz  this film was originally entitled if they only knew and dancing about architecture  watch for movie posters from swingers       chasing amy    and the texas chainsaw massacre    at the movie theatre where the characters of joan and keenan go on their first date  ,1,1
271,exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad  the review jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier  the return  his latest attempt to remain relevant  that sums up this entire movie  he says  been there  done that   no film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better  while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres  schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films   van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him  martial arts and guns  this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world  with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex  he joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  universal soldier  the return is truly poor  the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade  specifically terminator   judgement day and the similarly named soldier  soldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors  for the good of a planet  schwarzeneggers terminator in t tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine  the t  and jeanclaude  a former universal soldier  has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of  you guessed it  newer model soldiers  considering the poor box office performance of soldier  its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead  luc devereaux  van damme  was the sole remaining universal soldier  or unisol for short   until he was returned to a normal  if muscular  human form  in this sequel  technically the fourth film in the series  following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise   luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program  working with dylan cotner  xander berkeley  who interestingly also appeared in t   the unisol program has engineered a tougher  fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth  unfortunately  upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government  seth takes control of his soldiers  killing everyone in the building except for luc  his partner maggie  his daughter hillary and erin  a reporter trapped inside  the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive  while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers  most notably romeo  popular wrestler goldberg   there are lots of fights  gun battles  lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  there are so many clich  s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on  and in the course of a single night  they go from bickering to falling for each other  to kissing  erin is a patheticallywritten character  people are getting brutally gunned down all around her  and yet  not only does this not seem to frighten her  but she finds time to remind luc that she  isnt leaving without her story   whatever  other laughable moments include a  luc going to a strip club to get internet access  what   and b  a group of rangers  who after having been given good advice  luc tells them that their weapons are useless  and shows them a specific gun which should work better   choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway  guess who wins the battle    not one single scene in universal soldier  the return has any originality to it  when fuelled by don davis loud  driving music score  the films many fights become almost passable  but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves  director mic rodgers  a former stunt coordinator  keeps the action coming at a rapid pace  with only a few token serious moments to be found  his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li  rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet  however  is an injustice  im not sure that anyone  not even robert deniro or edward norton  could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good  one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  he cringes  looks down and mutters  uh    uhm    they all do  i saw it on  minutes  eh he he he  the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg  he chews up every scene he is in  obviously enjoying his role immensely  he even gives the film a few laughs  as he mutters things like  i really dont like that guy  every time he fails to kill luc  sadly  his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier  the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo  ,0,0

274,the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission  he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth  but misses  after they ricochet off his face  he says   not a good start   as it turns out  this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence  but to the rest of the movie as well  in this  the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong  chan plays an international operative codenamed  condor   and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazis during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war  for some reason  condor is given his mission at the u  s  embassy in spain  i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene  they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart  watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country  most notably in europe  the chase will take itself through a marketplace  and a fruit cart will be overturned  its almost a guarantee  anyway     condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden  the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it  which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly  to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly  condor is accompanied by a desert expert  carol cheng  and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold  eva cobo   there arent supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain  but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something  although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission  they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts  in fact  most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight  i suppose this isnt so bad  since chans action is really the best part of the movie  and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway  if youve never seen a jackie chan movie  dont expect a great plot  but do expect to be entertained by his moves  they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human  knowing that he does his own stunts  and knowing that this is the real stuff  no computermasked bungee cords here  makes the action sequences all the more exciting  youve got to hand it to a guy whos probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art  also of note in this  as in any jackie chan movie  is the humor  as far as i know  none of his films take themselves too seriously  and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongueincheek quality about them  what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes  unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme  where the fights get you on the visceral level  fight scenes in chans movies are simply entertaining  you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh  unfortunately  even chans mastery cant save this film  the plot and characters are so weak that they dont hold the movie together at all  and the acting is terrible  carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past  but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off  this  combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying  ,0,0
275,miramax  disinvited  online media from press screenings of scream   they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoilerfilled reviews and post them prior to the films february th release dateunsound reasoning  you see  net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionalsmiramax surely knows the difference between a member of the online film critics society  ofcs  and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at aint it cool news  no  the  mini major was afraid wed let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit  that scream  is a dismal conclusion to the beloved  by this writer  at least  franchise  something smells rotten in the state of california right from the getgo  cotton weary  liev schrieber   the former lover and wouldbe killer of maureen prescott  sidneys mother  is juggling phone calls in his luxury car    once considered a danger to society  weary now hosts his own talk show    cotton   a clever  if dated  jab at american pop culture   of course  a new ghostface dials him up  and  with memories of screams unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind  we immediately wonder  where is the killer  the backseat  the next car  thrilling prospects  to be sure  but actually  ghostface is at the weary residence  waiting for cottons girlfriend  kelly rutheford  to finishing showering  whats missing from this sequence  and indeed scream s remaining frights  most disappointingly  the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes  one of which might spring to life   is an elaborate and attenuated payoff  our other surviving regulars have become estranged  sidney  campbell  is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and passwordprotected locks  while dewey  arquette  acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream s moviewithinamovie   stab    and gale weathers  cox arquette  headlines a gossipy news program  murder reunites them  as knifewielding ghostface stalks the set of  stab    imitating its sadistic screenplayand hishertheir own personal draft climaxes with sidneys death  the appeal of ghostfaces villainy is that heshethey could be your boyfriend  your classmate  your next door neighbour    or a combination of people  scream was the first of its kind  a slasher mystery  with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next  but also who isare the perpetrator  s  and what isare hishertheir motive  ironic selfreflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  with scream   the novelty of ghostfaces evermutating identity has worn off some  but the character remains conceptually potent  conceptually  the execution of ghostfaces master plan this time around is creaky  because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what wed come to understand in scream and scream   the movie gets in the silly habit of saying  all bets are off   in reference to the  rules  of a trilogys third act  but theres a difference between rule breaking and cheating  with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream   that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of  stab     kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven  cravens direction of scream  is lazy in most respects  how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo  the slacker duo of kevin smith movies   akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny  it pains me to write this  but scream s comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais  as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart   jamie kennedy  resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream    and parker posey  through sheer force of will as a bactress   the visuals are much weaker in part three  as wellthe occasional sweeping gesture of peter demings camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before    aside  in the wake of columbine  craven toned down the violence significantly for scream why the sanctimony  when scream and scream  are still readily available on video store shelves   finally  marco beltramis music cues the suspense too blatantlydo you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream   its mostly silent  sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere  here  they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nervejangling score  i look at scream  as coming from an alternative universe  the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iiiwoefully out of synch with its prequels  scream  is a nightmare instead of nightmarish  and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs  the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t   part three must disappoint  ,0,1

278,i have no real tangible proof of this  but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script  written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director  then it is actually possible to make a good movie  using their logic  all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of superfamous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget  this is the only way i can fathom how th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time  not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre   now  before i continue to ferociously attack whats wrong with this film  i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller  catherine zetajones plays virginia baker  an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal  sean connery   if youve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before  i really dont have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details  the two team up for various jobs  stealing various things for various purposes  the problem we come to is that weve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesnt break any new ground in the bigbudgethollywoodaction genre  the result is that the entire production feels contrived  im going to be completely honest here  pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the runtime was looking at catherine zetajones  now while this may be a compliment for ms  zetajones  it certainly isnt for either the writers or the director  who are not nearly as clever as they think they are  just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between  entrapment  and  blackmail   with an eighty million dollar budget  youd think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx  well  youd be wrong  the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular  unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment  die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by   years  the reality is that after  minutes of watching this picture  you know exactly whats going to happen  despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists  many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zetajones in extremely tightfitting clothing  one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laserbeams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask  nothing wrong with that  but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was  so why didnt she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room  ill tell you why  because its a great excuse to photograph zetajones posterior as it slides underneath those beams  and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing  the rehearsal   ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie  and though he has great screen presence  although so do connery and zetajones  and the most interesting character in the film  not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss  a concept i invented just to describe this picture   one last complaint  entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building  or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot  hell spontaneously disappear in ninjalike fashion  i can picture amiel patting himself on the back  thinking to himself  itll leave the audience wondering for days  how did he do that   we know jon  its called editing  ,0,0
279,though it is a fine piece of filmmaking  theres something about elizabeth    that left me a bit cold  and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films  particularly these days  i just didnt care about the characters  to me  the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters  be they imagined or historical as the case may be  that the audience gives a hoot about  and though elizabeth works well on many levels  it falls short of excellence because of that very reason  elizabeth takes place in england in   as queen mary  half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying  before she dies  though  she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs  as a result  amidst much anger within the council  elizabeth becomes the queen of england  the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life  much of the film deals with elizabeths love for lord robert  a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen  there is much ado about her lack of a husband  and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation  the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece  as love interests are such a character driven element  i didnt much care about the characters  perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett  and so i didnt have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials  the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queens most loyal advisor  sir francis  and attenborough as a wellmeaning but oldfashioned lead council  why then  you must be asking  do i recommend elizabeth  simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer  kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin  neither of whom i have heard  create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side  the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches  cellars and castles in th century europe  each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blownout white light from windows  the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot  indeed  elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade  ranking with kundun and braveheart  watch also for the incredibly  godfatheresque  mass murder scene  it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films  ,1,1
280,for  original sin   the road to the screen has been rocky  initially slated for release last november  the film was bumped twice  finally landing in the dog days of summer   advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics  generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands  so is  original sin  really all that bad  yes it is  but the melodrama does offer some rewards  the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of ta  with angelina jolie providing the  t  and antonio banderas the  a    more importantly  the movie is entertainingly bad  veteran readers know that  as a rule  i dont encourage people to patronize lousy films  most of the time  there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides  the  lets go laugh at the failings of others  mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable  but things are different this summer  quality films  to put it mildly  have been few and far between  so as far as im concerned  its fair to find our kicks where we may    original sin  will never join such treasures as  valley of the dolls    road house  and  showgirls  in the bad movie hall of fame  but itll do until something worse comes along  the film  adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel   waltz into darkness   which was also the source for the  francois truffaut film   mississippi mermaid    opens in a turnofthecentury prison  as jolies character  slated for a dawn execution  tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny  the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like   this is not a love story  it is a story about love   wary of local golddiggers  cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas  banderas  makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america  listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign golddiggers  a practical man  luis chooses a frumpy looking lady  hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children  imagine his surprise when his fianc  e  julia russell  jolie   turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo  julia explains that she sent a different womans image because she didnt want to be selected solely for her pretty face  luis then confesses his deception  leading julie to state  with great significance   we have something in common  we are both not to trusted   after their wedding  luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking  with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible  jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun  although the filmmakers insistence on using one of banderas legs to cover jolies crotch makes it look like hes trying to climb her  luis  the stupidest man who ever lived  immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia  despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded  his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up  luis must force julia to write to her sister emily  who is frantic over her lack of communication  shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck  finally  when she cleans out his accounts and disappears  luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong  incidentally  if youre afraid im giving too much away  rest assured that all of this happens in the first  minutes of the movie  leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists  a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass  along the way  private detective walter downs  played by thomas jane  who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie      turns up  hired by the frumpy womans sister to find out what happened to the real julia  luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist  having decided that if he cant have her  he will kill her  oh  the pathos of it all  the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story  adjusting their performances accordingly  banderas is suitably impassioned  while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting  and with those lips  she can really pout   as for thomas jane  he starts off acting suspicious and cagey  then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness  his most startling moment comes when  to prove his power to humiliate  he forces luis against a wall  verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a fullon kiss  if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape  show them this chilling scene  and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler  show them  original sin   ,0,1

282,kevin smith is like a big kid  his humor is that of a sophisticated juveniles  he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books  having also written a few  he also has a cult following  mostly composed of teenagers  college students  and smiths own fellow adolescentminded grownups  smith is hilarious in person and in writing  but when he tries to be earnest and moralize  that is when he goes wrong  kevin smith is a better writer than director  and hell be the first to tell you that  that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavyhanded  great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them  this was true in the overrated chasing amy  and it is true for dogma as well  that is not to say smiths message is a bad one  in dogma  smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and gods desires is superior to anyone elses  basically  dogmatism is bad  changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible  and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight  they also know what is best for you  whether you like it or not  this is not exactly a new message in movies  see inherit the wind   but i have no problems with recycling old ones  particularly since dogmas protesters are proving smiths point  smiths own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book  but this is smiths personality  and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible  or koran  etc   correctly  or if there even is a correctly  and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns  the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany  linda fiorentino  being chosen by voice of god  metatron  alan rickman   to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels  bartleby  ben affleck  and angel of death  loki  matt damon   along the way  forgotten thirteenth apostle  rufus  chris rock   stripper muse serendipity  salma hayek   and slacker duo jay and silent bob  jason mewes and kevin smith himself  come to bethanys aid  fallen muse  azrael  jason lee   proves to be the behindthescenes manipulator for all the chicanery  the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smiths points  and in itself  has little dramatic momentum  among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman  jesus was black  and the bible was written by a bunch of racist  misogynistic white men  of course  kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself  they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic  smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie  when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes  smith thought it might give validation to protesters claims that the film was sacrilegious  but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke  the films humor is uneven  some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burningbush kind of entrance  but many of the films jokes just bomb  as in virtually anything involving salma hayeks serendipity  also  some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away  still  smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace  among the actors  fiorentino and rickman stand out by far  fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight  damon and affleck are fairly lackluster  rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith  but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob  who recur in all of smiths movies  are much more in line with smiths brand of humor  bud cort  george carlin  janeane garofalo  guinevere turner  and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances  ,1,1
283,all right  all right  we get the point  despite all similarities to the bestselling story  speechless is  not  based on the romance between  presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin  in fact  the script was in development well before   still  the comparisons are inevitable  until one realizes a critical difference  no  its not that the speechless twosome are speech writers  not campaign managers  its that carville and matalins story is actually interesting  speechless is a limp  poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy  speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign  where kevin vallick  michael keaton  and julia mann  geena davis  meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep  what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign  kevin is a sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches  while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate  at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship  but eventually they let down their guard and become closer  but there are plent of obstacles in the way  including julias studreporter fiance  christopher reeve  and a series of stunts which continue to prove that alls fair in love and politics  the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that theyre crazy about each other  screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes  then developing the antagonism  its a noble attempt to shake things up  but unfortunately it just doesnt work  part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do  but in speechless they already know theyre attracted to each other  and were left with waiting for the campaign to end so theyll admit that they love each other already  there is such a herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour  inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton  and with those performances most of their scenes together  the problems begin with their initial courtship  which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is a wiseass  davis is radiantly beautiful  and keaton is generally entertaining  but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit  in a couple of scenes  like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain  they actually achieve some measure of connection  for the most part  however  theyre just actors spouting lines  you keep waiting for a little spark  and it never happens  perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics  the setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix  but thats never the tone that underwood is going for  he wants a warm  fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score  and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background  it might as well have been a story about rival grocers  and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be  i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert kings previous screenplay  the dana carvey flop clean slate  so i had some hopes for speechless  but while there is wit in the words  this is a script which was probably much better on paper  on screen  its still paper thin  ,0,0
284,i like movies with albert brooks  and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks  lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies  his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today  inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator  you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film  while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent  talk films  which are finding their way into theaters  the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with  but even if we cant  brooks has the talent to make them comfortable  and therefore we laugh  teenagers and jim carrey fans probably wont find an albert brooks movie very funny  but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will  put simply  brooks comedy is intelligent  mother is albert brooks latest film  and it does not disappoint  brooks plays john henderson  a middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce  he makes an attempt at dating  but fails miserably  he then has dinner with his brother jeff  rob morrow   a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life  jeff has a good job  a loving family  and most of all  a warm relationship with their mother beatrice  debbie reynolds   after dinner  john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice  and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is  in comparison  beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him  and john gives it right back to her  at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life  she says   i love you   and john replies with   i know you think you do   the thing is  beatrice is not overt with her criticisms  but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading  its the kind that goes something like   yes  dear  i think you do that wonderfully  but      it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy  theres always the big but  john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women  either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation  or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner  he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home  he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out  and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is    a great experiment   he calls it  brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film  especially in the interaction john has with his mother  theres a scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house  and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito  and having explained to his mother about the  great experiment   beatrice asks   now explain to me again why you dont want to stay at a hotel   she still doesnt get it  and it is absolutely hilarious  in the same scene  we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh  she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over  when john points out the ice on the sherbet  beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze    youve named the ice   asks john  hes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator  such as a twentypound block of cheese    the freezer was a good invention   says john   but its not supposed to be used for everything  thats why its smaller than the refrigerator   its something most of us find strangely familiar  brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur  for example  in defending your life  his and meryl streeps characters are in a comedy club having a discussion  when theyre finished and walk out  brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line   and so the moral is  if you have to fart  go outside   you dont know what the joke was because you couldnt hear him during the entire scene  but i must have laughed for the next five minutes  it seemed so out of context  in this film  brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene  i dont want to give them away  but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past  johns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn  and we as the audience learn right along with him  his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with  but as john spends more time with her  we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth  watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way  on screen  brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character  you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world  in a way  hes very much like yosarian of catch  expect with something of an attitude  casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect  she assumes the part with ease  even moving and speaking a little slowly  and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character  this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her  as his first choice  brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice  but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband  who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease  that may be just as well  since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely  rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and  for all his success in his job and family  is slowly exposed as a mamas boy  the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes  a solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother  additionally  the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals  and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting  how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this   beatrice  you must think im some kind of moron  john  no  i think your someone who thinks im a moron  beatrice  well  it takes one to know one  ,1,1
285,as i write the review for the new hanksryan romantic comedy youve got mail  i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet  i am also aware that i have just spent the last  hours watching the worlds biggest paid commercial for america online  and i wonder  is that so bad  well  the commercial part is  as for the movie  well  as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan  i think ill be okay  to paraphrase james berardinelli  whose reviews i admire very much  tom hanks and meg ryan can act  they are both wonderful  but for all of hanks glorious work in serious films  such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan  and his glorious triumph in philadelphia  i like him best when hes suitably obnoxious  tom hanks is wonderful when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when hes going to get the girl  the only question is how  meg ryan  americas high school sweetheart  can act  shes had a handful of memorable performances  including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally  i must not mention what she does  due to the  well  um  you get the idea  and if you dont  get the movie fantastic   but  i like her best when shes  well  perky  she is so adorably perkycute that together with hanks  they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime  some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples  but i dont really know  all i know is that i just like them both  they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thats really hard to resist  and im not going to even try  theyre just really  really cute  sweet  and charming  hanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron  who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle  here  the setup is a little different  kathleen kelly  ryan  owns a small childrens bookstore which her mother founded  years ago and passed down to her  she is successful  beautiful  and dates a wellknown columnist with very radical idea  kinnear   she is also having an affair  of sorts  you see  kathleen  with the handle shopgirl  is secretly emailing ny  they have a strictly undetailed relationship  there are no specifics  and they have no idea who each other is  ny happens to be joe fox  hanks   a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of megabookstores  run by his father  coleman   fox books has decided to open a store on the west side  right across from a little childrens bookseller named  shop around the corner   run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly  every morning  these two email each other silly  and every day  they fight  to the death     its a charming premise  and one that works nicely  balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance  there is no  lets have sex tonight  mantra  if youll excuse my bluntness  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love  hmm  well  the movie goes through twists and turns  having some sad moments and happy ones  until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan  hook up   to use modern terminology  and kiss their way into happiness  you know its going to happen  the question is now  thankfully  ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey  kinnear  chappelle  and a host of others  including a great scene involving brothers  aunts  and two sweet kids  its all cute and wonderful  and for all of the idealism  it makes me feel good  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is  he is  i believe  americas greatest actor  does he show it here  nah  but hes still tom hanks  and shes still meg ryan  which is what this movie boils down to  its pure confection  all the bits about the godfather  the jokes  the superb script  its all really sweet  there are some immense flaws  like pacing  the last third of the movie really doesnt work as well as i would have liked  and for a romantic comedy  its slow  once hanks knows the secret  it gets really slow  i even looked at my watch a couple times  to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for  so that i could get home at a reasonable hour  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated  email  when my kids are my age  i dont know what well be using  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody  and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history  they just work together  and its nice to see  it gives you  well  a smile  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious  and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was  ive always believed that movies are very powerful  very powerful indeed  you see  mankind has three abilities he needs to survive  the ability to think  entertain  and procreate  movies can definitely do the first two  and as for the third  well  id rather not think about that  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint  and that films that entertained you were good  because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had  hanks was the driving force behind one of the years best films in saving private ryan  which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world  hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical  as is this movie  its a sweet  lovely affair with a technology twist  it may be a long commercial  but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face  ,1,1
286,according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers  isolated motels  diners  gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers  at the beginning of eye of the storm   german american thriller directed by yuri zeltser  one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up  ten years later their son steven  played by bradley gregg   who was blinded during the incident  still runs motel together with his older brother ray  played by craig sheffer   hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone  played by dennis hopper  gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra  played by lara flynn boyle   their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed  yuri zeltser  author of this film  was obviously inspired by hitchcocks psycho  but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot  instead of norman bates we have two brothers  one of them traumatised physically  another mentally  sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband  eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense  with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere  the acting is fine  hopper  gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles  but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine  unfortunately  eye of the storm  which was supposed to be intense psychological drama  deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale  in the end  this film reminds us that original approach cant prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities    special note to the profiler fans  ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killers girlfriend   ,0,0

288,its been hours since i returned from the much anticipated scifi opus mission to mars  and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar  why  the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy  stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera  instead shooting for the angle of a feelgood science fiction drama more akin to   a space odyssey  i got the feeling that most of my fellow moviegoing patrons were expecting another armageddon  but no  mission to mars certainly isnt one large action sequence about colossal disaster  this is a supposedly thoughtful  familyfriendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel  you have been warned  of course  crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible  see apollo  for an excellent example   but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation  brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off  when he gets his hands on an intelligent  systematically practical script like the untouchables or mission  impossible  the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement  although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally   of course  theres also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name  including snake eyes and the notorious bomb the bonfire of the vanities      all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood  that term may be too harsh  but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars  my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  if i were gary sinise  i wouldnt touch de palma with a foot pole  sinise is a wonderful  wonderful actor  but after appearing in snake eyes and this vomitinducing sham  im sure he wouldnt want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration  the academy awardwinner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell  a man who recently lost his wife  kim delaney  and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars  oops  forgot to mention the year     after a barbecue gettogether for the astronauts  we cut to luc goddard  don cheadle  and his team  who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  suddenly  a towering formation of rocks and soil  probably best dubbed a sand tornado  appears and creates a whirlwind of suction  for some reason  the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this  as if it were a lovely piece of art  the team is killed within seconds  expect for luc  who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  immediately  a second mission  consisting of astronauts mcconnell  husband and wife woody and terri blake  tim robbins and connie nielsen  and phil ohlmyer  jerry oconnell   are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars  lets put the secret on hold for now  and discuss the trip there  it is explained  whether scientifically accurate or not  probably not   that a trip to mars takes roughly six months  im not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind mm didnt capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia  instead  we join the team during their final days aboard the ship  what happened during the five months prior to this  did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes  still  there are few nicely tense moments  maybe the only in the movie  during the timeframe involving a fuel leak  depalmas direction is quite good in these scenes  although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent  organ music in space  cmon   theres a few good  imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese  a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud  its a colossal bummer that mission to mars is poorly assembled and laughably written  with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists  as mentioned before  anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed    maybe even cheated  after the unbelievably hokey final shot  with the words  the end somehow adding insult to injury   a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen  others muttered obscenities  shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling jeez  that sucked   okay  it did suck  but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy    after all  they do pretty well  sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes  robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple  and funnyman oconnell  well  he has a couple lines are actually amusing  and intentionally so   the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive  so  by golly  where did this mission go wrong  looking back on the appalling experience  i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have  while watching mission to mars  my suggestion would be to immediately abort  or better yet  dont even strap yourself in for liftoff  ,0,0

290,every yearevery year at the festival  i wait for that film to come along  that one that just pulls me out of my seat  sticks its face up next to my nose  and roars  surprise   into my bewildered visage  its almost always a surprise  it sure as niflheim was this time  amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale  of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  and  in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film  it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale  where we roll our eyes occasionally  smirk to ourselves  and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a  boy  i wish that could happen  sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash  another e  t  another short circuit  this film floored me  for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept  the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough  and presents itself well enough  to make it more of an american folk tale  with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time  america has always had its mythical heros  its paul bunyans and john waynes  this film presents us with more general  but still universal  ideals  the honest  innocent children who have their own inner wisdom  the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage  honor  and love for their respective sport  the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding  but has the grit to get things done when they need doin  does the latter sound familiar    amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters  but it never leaves you with the feeling that its artificial  that it stands behind glass  or that any sharp breezeor  more importantly  sharp thoughtwill shatter the wax facade of the panorama  this is a very sturdy scenario  the principals are always given dialogue  and always give performancesalways  it just blows me away   which made them seem real  yet enforces their particular mythic role  the writerproducer  david field  seems to literally take all the  yeah  but in real life  this would have happen  thoughts you get in your head  sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading  in a stronger way then before  astounding  he uses obstacles to the plot to  enforce  it  i am truly impressed  indeed  envious  with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay  its so very unusual  especially in a hollywood film  i dont want to give too much away  but the basic premise is that chuck  joshua zuehlke   the little league pitcher  decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons  his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete  a boston basketball player  alex english    amazing  grace smith  and  well  im leaving it at that because i wouldnt spoil this film for you for the world  let me just say this  though  i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply  i dont give a rats ass for the political pointofview this film expresses  one way or another  im recommending you go see this film because  and only because  its an excellent story  told with excellence  no  i dont believe what happens in this film could happen in real life  while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted  i believe in careful negotiations  mutual verification  etc  screw what i think  the point is  this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen  this is the natural and moreall the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion  and a much better script to boot  it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhoodand  more importantly  without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of selfconsciousness  special kudos to  both zuehlke  a reallife little league pitcher who was picked for the part  and english  a forward for the denver nuggets  for their seamless personification of their characters  jamie lee curtis  who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazings manager and friend  william l  peterson  in a  big  change from his role in to live and die in l  a   as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it  and gregory peck  as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was  and who some numbskulls still probably think he is ,1,1
291,michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels  many of which are science fiction  the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel  so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a bigbudget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel  congo failed  and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better  it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good  the film is expensive  over one hundred million dollars  is long   minutes  has a terrific cast  including dustin hoffman  samuel l  jackson  and sharon stone  but has little that is really original and less that is exciting  several years ago dr  norman goodman  played by dustin hoffman  was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered  the plan he wrote was only semiserious  but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien  now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes  peter coyote  to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early s  suddenly normans less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft  included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams  samuel l  jackson   biologist beth halperin  sharon stone   and astrophysicist ted fielding  liev schreiber   together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets  one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of goldtoned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship  what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances  director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects  the problem here is he is making a bigbudget science fiction film  it has some effects  but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen  the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewers imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting  that could be a reasonable approach in a lowbudget film  but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster  it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put  they dont  hoffmans acting seems muted  jackson seems to laid back  we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads  levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance  and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybodys guess  a cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price  look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors  most science fiction spectaculars these days have secondtier actors and firsttier special effects  levinson tries secondtier effects  and firsttier actors  but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer  perhaps scifi spectaculars are just not an actors medium  the result gets a  on the  to  scale and  on the  to  scale  ,0,0
292,the thirteenth floor is a bland  obligatory exercise in genre filmmaking  if i hadnt recently watched the matrix and open your eyes  both of which are similar but far superior  i might have been a little nicer to this picture  craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall  the rich cocreator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss  armin muellerstahl   everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one  and characters stare at each other for maddeninglylong periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level  the acting is okay  but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of  and features a script  copenned by director josef rusnak  loaded with cliches and stock characters  there are individual scenes and ideas that work  i like the thought of a sentient computer program  but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree  producer roland emmerich  based on this and his previous directorial efforts  seems hellbent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre sciencefiction  ,0,1
293,  theres nothing new under the sun  is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means  lets find something to copy   of course there are very few completely original ideas  even earthshattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience  there is  after all  no need to reinvent the wheel time after time  recently it seems that hollywood doesnt feel the need to even rewrite the script  my understanding of the word  sequel  is a continuation of the story  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalmas adaptation of the steven king novel  this is your dream come true  rachel  emily bergl   a high school outcast  is beginning to notice weird things happening around her  doors slam shut by themselves  glass globes blow up  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out  the incrowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event  any of this sound familiar  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as  carrie   theres little to do but wait for the inevitable ending  the effects are a bit better this time around  but the film doesnt work nearly as well  there are a couple of minor plot differences  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest  and  uh  there must be other story changes but none stand out  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell  over  years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie  now a high school counselor  she befriends rachel  but her characters potential is squandered  theres too much about sue that doesnt make sense  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates  sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachels mother is in  still living in the same small town  the woman with a wellknown history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease  this may be the one original idea in the film  but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a  disease  is never explained  sues eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldnt figure out what to do with her  blink and youll miss it  some of the events are filmed in black and white  but the rationale for this is unknown  it doesnt add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random    the rage  retains some of the trappings of  carrie  without the meaning  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating  here theres an abundance of red  but for no apparent purpose  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film  and the flaws in this one  ,0,0
294,if anything   stigmata  should be taken as a warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close to one another  of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year  it is clearly the worst  i suppose i should have seen this coming  after all   blair witch  thoroughly creeped me out   sixth sense  was mildly spooky  and then  stir of echoes  had its moments  but wasnt anything id lose sleep over  clearly  the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping  is it then any surprise that  stigmata  is the dullest  most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while  no  not really  patricia arquette plays frankie page  a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother  as it turns out  the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest  the priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan  gabriel byrne  because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue  father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs  but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue  his investigation is soon called off  however  when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata  in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ  father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story  considering shes an atheist  but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself  he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on  he eventually begins to suspect that his boss  cardinal houseman  jonathan pryce   is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  as it turns out  the dead priest had been working on the translation of a  fifth gospel  before they were excommunicated  the new rupert wainwright music video      i mean film  stigmata  is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse  indeed  it would have been good if it were a music video  because its only interesting for about five minutes  im not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion  doubleexposure  and extreme closeups  whoaaaaaa       other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and  yes  he has been to film school  his camera trickery is interesting for a little while  but eventually  it becomes headacheinducing  what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue  such as it is   with wainwright screaming at the audience   see  look at what i can do  im an excellent director   maybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse  or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying  ooh  scary    if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery  i didnt see it  just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story  here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever  arrrrrrrghhhh      then again  the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if  stigmata  had a story or characters that were remotely engaging  though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help  he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  where are plot continuity and character development when you need them  case in point  frankie page is the character that  i assume  we are supposed to identify and sympathize with  but we arent given any back story on her character  or any reason to like her  the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser  who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building  and shes kind of cute  so lets start the bleeding  the fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help  either  according to frankie page  what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back  go clubbing  sure  that makes sense  arquette  byrne  and pryce give it the old college try  but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking  scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat  because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  even though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes  she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon  even more curiously  he seems to be interested in her advances  father andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic  as for pryce  he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle   ill get you  my pretty   for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded  trust me  im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain  whats worse  after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats  we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction  veers off in another  then another  and ends up being totally incomprehensible  first of all  the film doesnt even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details  how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary  how come an atheist like her was chosen  since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata  actually  im not sure what frankie was posessed by  supposedly  stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit  but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest  and later by some evil spirit  i think   which one is it  the answer to this question  of course  is very simple  the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr  wainwright wants to use this time  furthermore  the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrapup  and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church  if you do any research at all about the gospel of st  thomas  youll find that it is not being suppressed by the church  as the film seems to claim   but that it is readily available at your local library  theres nothing the catholics need to worry about  though    stigmatas  religion is so offbase that it cant be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church  if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters  they should have gone allout and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns  which would have been far more interesting  im not catholic  in fact  i don t care much for the catholic church  but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means  its rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as  stigmata  does  it s not thoughtprovoking  though it would like to be  and it is definitely not scary  though it pretends to be  im not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film  because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story  maybe its an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever  the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over  and over  and over  like so many films of the mtv generation  this one suffers from overkill  so much is overdone in  stigmata   that it eventually has no effect on the audience  leaving us to pick out the films  many  flaws  im also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st  thomas is so earthshattering  when we finally hear it  the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school  which means that for all its flash  the whole film is really much ado about nothing  the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog  and  stigmata  is it  ,0,0
295,one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made   seen  is just a few steps away from brilliance  however  those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss  the film received mixed reviews upon release  but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice  at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing  but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent  the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable  this piece of work is  intensity  its uncomfortable to watch  yet compelling    i want not to look  yet i cannot turn away   the story creeps along slowly and deliberately  crafted by visionary director david fincher  he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions  but not giving away too much too soon  this is the guy who directed the ominous  alien      seen  is even more ominous because the threat is real  its human and  while the script takes some artistic licence  the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic  that is  if a human being could be so intelligent  patient  wealthy  and disillusioned  after the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen  refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment   the initial character development takes place  morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset  a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society  brad pitt costars as detective david mills  the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys  these two fine actors give the film its human qualities  along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow  who plays tracy  mills wife   however  none of them stands out above the material  no disrespect intended  but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  an ironic note is that somerset has only a week  or   thats seven  days  left on the force to train his young protege  the title of the picture also refers to the  deadly sins  as chronicled by john milton in  paradise lost  gluttony  greed  sloth  lust  pride  envy   wrath  incidentally  i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found  its the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking  but i wont give that away  as i said  this has a great ending and no one should spoil it  anyway  the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the  sinners  suffer for it  the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man  they learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death  the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and  of course  somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way  if they didnt  it would be one short movie  the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story  we see a lot of blood  but its not especially violent  the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in  pulp fiction     seen  is gory  graphic  and disturbing  but all the gore is postdeath  still  if you tend to get queasy  dont eat food during this film  kevin spacey plays john doe  the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings  like many crazy men  he has some fine ideas  but some sick ways of expressing himself  spacey doesnt appear until the final  minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits  however  its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination  a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not  this character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone  no serial killer has ever been so creative    seen  is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing  what it lacks in those areas  it makes up for with believable dialogue  topnotch screenwriting  unexpected twists  and realistic characters  the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive  fincher uses lighting  music  and editing quite well  but his story is always the thrust of the film  fortunately  we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits  which are run backwards up the screen    its better to imagine what paths they will follow  this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget  its got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves    seen  raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves  useless triviacostars in s  seen   brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the  best supporting actor oscarpitt in   monkeys   spacey in  the usual suspects   for which he won   ,1,1
296,apparently  director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film  american history x  i dont know the details of the fight  but it seems that he is not happy with the final product  and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether  ive heard about this kind of thing happening before  and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce  as it is  i found american history x to be an extremely good film  not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism  but because of a powerful  charismatic performance from edward norton  its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear  but  here he is now  starring in his own film and making himself a star  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character  and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year  he plays a young man named derek vinyard  a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother  danny  edward furlong   mother  beverly dangelo   and sister  davin  jennifer lien   the film opens with a flashback  in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car  we find out that this lands him in prison  and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny  in the presenttime of the film  danny is in high school  and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother  much of the film is told in flashback  and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy  when derek is released  having served three years in prison  he finds that his brother is now a fullblown skinhead  derek  however  has given up the violence  and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid  thoughtless people  they are intelligent and articulate  and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms  its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach  but kaye has found the right note for his material  because american history x is a mainstream film  there has to be a redemption phase for our main character  some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic  i partially disagree with this  because  although i do not advocate racism in any way  its interesting the way kaye presents derek  he is a loud  obnoxious man  but hes also very smart  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable  his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men  its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs  and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up  of course  it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part  its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest  in addition to getting the look just right  hes perfect for this role  derek requires intelligence  depth  and a whole lot of shouting  and norton does it all with ease  even when hes at his meanest  derek has a likable quality to him  and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school  avery brooks  becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny  the other performances are all terrific  with standouts from furlong  dangelo  and lien  visually  the film is very powerful  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices  and most of them work nicely  lots of slowmotion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere  but  like a lot of movies lately  american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes  although the climactic scene is very moving  the picture ends with a pretentious  preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point  it felt like a slap in the face to be handfed a theme in such a simplistic way  it makes me wonder what  exactly  tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film  perhaps this last scene was the problem  its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good  in a time when so many movies are timid and weak  american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way  ,1,1

299,plot  derek zoolander is a male model  he is also very dumb and impressionable  for that reason  he is secretly hired and trained  so secret  that even he doesnt know about it  by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia  who wants to abolish child labor in his country  will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed  will zoolander ever grace the world his new  look   is this a funny movie  find out below    critique  theres a place in our world for  stupid comedies   films which dont pretend to take themselves seriously  are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes  theres also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history  might be an ideal circumstance during which to  relax  by watching something so completely frivolous  well  if youre in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment  ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time  of course  comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny  while others will grant them the  stupid   but consider it funny instead  i personally enjoyed it for the most part  cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry  snap  it was also nice to see several reallife models with small roles in the movie  not taking themselves too seriously  and if youre the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films  well  dont look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn  billy zane  winona ryder  christian slater  david duchovny  natalie portman and many  many others  i especially liked andy dicks complete makeover as the masseuse  hilarious  but with all films of this type  there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesnt work  a few particulars which didnt strike my fancy included the bulimia and  orgy  sequence with christine taylor  the breakdance fighting  and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this  why not just  make up  a country  instead of zeroing in on a certain people    i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general  since she wasnt all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then  more zoolander  dude    but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me  i almost pissed myself during the  gas station  disaster  absolutely adored the  walkoff  contest  with david bowie as the judge  no less  and appreciated many of zoolanders moronic oneliners   i was a merman    a merman      and i dare you to get his  monkey  photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie   youre a monkey  derek    a monkey    i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film  both of which zipped and zagged  and established a nice rhythm to it all  again  its to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone  but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer  you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well  if you thought the trailer was dumb  skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something  a film from which there is an obvious influence here  blue steel  baby    yeah    wheres joblo coming from  austin powers     austin powers      deuce bigalow     dude  wheres my car     freddy got fingered     jay  silent bob strike back     joe dirt     meet the parents     say it isnt so    ,1,1
300,bill condons  gods and monsters  is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale  ian mckellan   who made the horror classics  frankenstein  and  bride of frankenstein   since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film  there is no way to know how accurate the film is  but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations  whale  who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures  decided fifteen years before his death at age  to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him  as the film tells it  during the end of his life  whale  at his large home in l  a   became infatuated with the tall  handsome  and much younger man  clayton boone  brendan fraser   who was working as the gardener at his home  james whale  we learn quickly was  what many people refer to him as in the film   a dirty old man   in one of the opening scenes  a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees  on one condition  for every question he answers  the young man must take off an article of clothing  because of this episode  we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting  later making the excuse that his bright  white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off  clayon agrees  and doesnt really think much of this  much to the warnings of his friends  becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past  certainly  the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall  since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man  even though boone is not gay  and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life  as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis    gods and monsters  is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast  due to his sexual preference  and never got the recognition he would have liked  since he longed to be referred to as a  motion picture director   rather than a  horror director   and in one heartbreaking scene  he attends a party with boone being his guest  held by director george cuckor  and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore  it is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies  and when his career ultimately fell apart  so did his passion in life  as played brilliantly by ian mckellen  james whale comes off as a sad  but dignified man  and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others  just as long as he knew he was being true to himself  he never hid the fact that he was gay  however  even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession  and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person  through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone  boone  of course  only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to  while it means so much more to whale  who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life  although boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes  whale views him as the ideal man  not only one that is goodlooking  even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings  but one that will actually listen to him  since whale lives with only his loyal  but disapproving maid  touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave   it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world  and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor  although an extremely fine and mature picture  a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness  it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments  but it is a little thin  and the structuring of the  onagainoffagain  friendship at the films center is fairly predictable  we know early on where these two characters are headed  and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds  in lesser hands  this setup might have felt too calculated  but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this  also  a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar  effectively played by lolita davidovich   but abruptly dropped and never brought up again  if the film was not going to follow up on this side story  then it  perhaps  should have been taken out altogether    gods and monsters  is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture  impressively directed by bill condon  who  i sense  relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone  the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end  walking away from  gods and monsters   it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me  and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably  it is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them  based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life  which  ironically enough  is no one elses business in the first place  ,1,1
301,the happy bastards second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father  of course  thats the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy  a movie thats passable but isnt really considered some of sandlers best work  he doesnt actually play happy gilmore in the movie  but a variation of him  hes sonny coufax  a man whos living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his onedayaweek gig as a tollbooth man  tollbooth willie    his girlfriend  kristy swanson  is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him  enter a year old kid  whos mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate  jon stewart   whos off in china on a business trip  from there  coufax basically acts as the kids father  teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks  he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker  joey lauren adams   but  somehow  he also garners the attention of social services  who arent particularly pleased with coufaxs actions  as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid  the reason i say its not really sandlers best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie  showing some odd feelings that somehow didnt really belong in a sandler vehicle  i mean  it fits the movies tone and everything  and sandler handles it well  but its just oddly placed  thats all  fortunately  it doesnt destroy the goofy glee path its been following and it still makes you feel good  sandler does a good job here  as he does in most of his movies  rob schneider  however  is irritating as his friend  an immigrant delivery boy who cant read  stewart  in his minor time on screen  is great  and adams remains a joy to watch  look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum  hes a hoot  directed by dennis dugan  director of happy gilmore   the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with  again  there are faults  but  hey  everyone needs to get emotional sometimes  ,1,1

hasnt already been said  since the release of rumble in the bronx  back in   the u  s  release   jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on americas video shelves  having made over  films  jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of actioncomedy to the west  his latest release   shanghai noon   is a joyful tribute  spoof of the classic western  and by adding jackie chan into the genre  the tag line for the film   the western gets a kick in the pants   rings true  jackie stars as chon wang  a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china  the royal princess pei pei  lucy liu  is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture  unwilling to follow her fathers wishes  princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor  decides to escape to america  but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong  which will lead to the princess kidnapping and ransom  unable to take any legal action  the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden citys bravest guards  played by cui ya hi  rong guang yu  and eric chen  are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city  nevada  chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team  as he is looked upon as a buffoon  on a train in the u  s  jackie meets up with bandit roy obannon  owen wilson   he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog  looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him  with his gang in tow  roy attempts to rob the train  when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court  who also happens to be chon wangs uncle  chon wang gives chase  foiling the attempted robbery  but also leaving himself stranded in the desert  as the disgraced guard

friendly sioux tribe  gunslingers  a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride  brandon merrill   before once again running into roy    shanghai noon  is just good fun  the chemistry between the cast is remarkable  the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film  jackies performance is as good as anything hes done before  hes not called on to do much acting here  as the character is not written with any depth  but jackies natural charisma shines through  and his comic timing is so perfect  both physically and  surprise  verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on  owen wilson  last seen in the embarrassing remake of  the haunting   gives a good natured performance as roy obannon  his innocence is refreshing and fun  a bad guy thats not really bad  his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis  lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script  but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant  the character is a noble woman of status and wealth  but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment  the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances  nothing here is realistic  mind you    shanghai noon  is first and foremost a light  jovial film  and the performances match that style with ease  the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous  using calgary  alberta as the prime location  mr  mindel is able to create a lush  romantic western feel to the film  nothing here really looks like nevada  but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged  the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre  and as such  the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history  but with reverence to past films  homage to such films as  high noon   obviously    red river  and most notably  butch cassidy  the sundance kid  all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film  it is a comforting experience  at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant  here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and  dare i say  clich  s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing  here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre  this is the purest  horse opera  since the days of george obrian or john wayne  director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywoods past  in this  his first film mr  dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see  nothing here really stands out  or takes ones attention away from the story or action  and that is as it should be  when jackie chan is your star  and what of the action and stunts  well  while not up to a level of  drunken master   or any of jackies hong kong films   shanghai noon  is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before  his timing  choreography  and creativity are still as sharp as ever  jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films  obvious to those of us that have seen those films  but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar   finally jackie can honestly say  that he has made an u  s   his way and incorporating his style  to sum up   shanghai noon  is a fun summer confection  not too heavy and not too light  a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy  parents be advised there are scenes of smoking  drunkenness and peyote use   an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again  ,1,1

304,the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do  lives are often at stake  and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable  prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice  the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor  psychologist  and sham artist  in addition to being a police officer  he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence  or failing that  must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower  most of all  the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible  and quickly gain control of the situation  dominate the conversation  and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants  it takes a pretty smart person to do that  but what if the hostageholding criminal is just as smart  what if hes also able to think on his feet  in fact  what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor  it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f  gary grays the negotiator  in this film  police negotiator danny roman  samuel l  jackson  is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force  when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home  roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder  faced with the scorn of most of the police department  and under close scrutiny by the media  roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office  i dont quite remember if the captain actually said   i hate to do this  but      although it wouldnt surprise me if he did  luckily  the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above  after being offered a takeitorleaveit deal by the district attorney  roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum  j  t  walsh   taking him and others hostage  and proclaiming he has been framed  although romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational buildup  gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian  kevin spacey  which soon ensue  jackson  while a superb actor  is miscast in the role of roman  the actor has become so popular  and so often identified as a protagonist  notable exceptions can be found  such as in jackie brown   that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats  the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence  how can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage  no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier  unfortunately  this preconception saps the film of some of its wouldbe suspenseful moments  and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability  almost every time hes in a scene  jackson steals it without looking back  when spacey appears  the film has already run about a third of its course  his is an interesting character  made out to be some kind of negotiating superman  our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation    i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower  but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone   he says  when he gets the call to action  however  he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be  soon  his character has to negotiate not only with roman  but also with the swat commander  david morse  who is itching to send in a team to take roman out  all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation  should negotiations fail  this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor  as the second protagonist  spacey measures up nicely  gray really lucked out with this cast  david morse as commander beck  ron rifkin as commander frost  and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent  and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey  the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices  morse played a similar role in the rock  rifkin played the d  a  in l  a  confidential  and spencer played a police detective in cop land  with the level of acting  however  this can be forgiven  also in the supporting cast  paul giamatti as rudy  one of the hostages  is notable for the comic relief he provides  his character is initially so slimy  and giamatti himself just looks so shifty  that you expect to laugh before he even says anything  fortunately  this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film  but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout  j  t  walsh  as the suspicious internal affairs inspector  clocks in with one of his final performances  sadly  the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year  and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film  walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam  backdraft  and nixon  for one of his best performances  check out sling blade  in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton  when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march  walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success  the actors performed together in a few good men   the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh  and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role  it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing  in the end  the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality  were served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best  as an audience  were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie  and wed like to see if one will dominate the film  both provide some pretty good entertainment  ,1,1
305,the best thing about   lake placid  is that its only  minutes long and when its over youre glad that you didnt waste more than an hour and a half of your time  its nothing more than a bad ripoff of   jaws   and i think thats being kind   it was written by david e  kelly   ally mcbeal   as a horrorcomedy but fails at both  miserably  i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once  the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in   anaconda   the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine  that brings the local sheriff  brendan gleeson  and a fishandgame warden  bill pulman  to investigate  also  a paleontologist  bridget fonda  from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover  oliver platt  flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast  soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it  theres also an eccentric old lady  betty white  who lives by the lake and has a few secrets  as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor  h  dont go for a serious approach towards the material but they also dont have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either  the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting  theyre all basically idiots  if they had any brains the croc wouldnt have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldnt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did  but then again  if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie  basically   lake placid  is best undiscovered  ,0,0
306,with the success of the surprise hit alien  directed by ridley scott  a sequel was inevitable  in fact  after watching the first film  a sequel was wanted  particularly by this reviewer  handing over the directors chair to recent box office gem james cameron  who had only made two films previous to this one  pirahna ii  a surprisingly dull film  and terminator  making cameron a household name   the alien series got a facelift of immense proportions  instead of being a suspensescience fiction film  cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture  what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created  a film like aliens comes along only once in a while  and when it does  audiences are usually unprepared for it  i never saw this movie in theaters  but i wish i could have  the terror and fright must have been unimaginable  most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear  aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen  with a science fiction plot  cameron gives aliens added testosterone  pumping up the action and fire power from the original film  in fact  aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original  perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine  as the case may be  never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film  and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character  sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about  placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual  but because of weavers presence  a woman is the only suitable hero  aliens begins  years after alien ended  lieutenant ellen ripley  weaver  is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened  she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens  but  the company  is doubtful  they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left  despite stern warnings from ripley  the company remains rigid and wont call the families back  however  when the company loses contact with the colony  ripleys story seems much more feasible  one of the companys directors  carter burke  paul reiser   wants to gather a team to travel to the planet  this team includes a buff private vasquez  jenette goldstein   a questionable corporal hicks  michael biehn   and a loyal android bishop  lance henriksen   burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony  arriving on the planet  the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoontype environment  the only survivor is  year old rebecca  newt  jorden  carrie henn   ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become  and she becomes newts surrogate mother  ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened  and soon  all hell breaks loose  aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scotts version  it also multiplies the number of aliens in general  alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member  except ripley  who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo  aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens  and as a result  the chills are incredibly heightened  then again  this is james cameron  the guy who has given us true lies and terminator   judgment day  he is the best action director out there  topping renny harlin  who directed cliffhanger   and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes  and aliens has the motherload  with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film  aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion  i cant recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout  never dropping for a moment  just when you think the movie is over  something else will occur  and it starts right back up again  with a seemingly endless conclusion  aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history  this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film  as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen  using flawless special effects  the climax is exhausting  leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety  of course  for a film of this genre to work properly  the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see  aliens is completely realistic  even a decade after its initial release  the special effects are wonderfully seamless  with a terrifying alien to go with them  one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music  composed by cameronregular james horner  horner has created a terrific score  receiving an oscar nomination for his work  not only that  horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film  or science fiction film ever  and that includes   a space odyssey  which was mainly a compilation of wellknown composers   in fact  the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music  the production design is incredible  which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy  dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive  but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from welllit locations  normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer  aliens uses lights to scare the viewer  then  of course  is the cinematography  which uses point of view shots  along with video feeds in order to build suspense  some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley  surprisingly  the acting is not only above average for this genre  but some of the best  sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley  incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hardedged persona  weaver soars above the rest in this film  but she is supposed to  carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child  developing a threedimensional character from her quiet attitude  lance henriksen is terrific as bishop  showing that androids dont always have to be flat characters  jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role  and steals several scenes of her own  though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isnt fighting   michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film  however  biehn does a good job  making it seem original again  paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director  but reiser manages to pull it off quite well  however  i still see him as paul on tvs  mad about you    a very good cast  which also includes bill paxton and william hope  highlights this action film  making it stand out from others  aliens is rightfully rated r for violence  gore  language  and terror  aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre  as alien was more of a suspensehorror film  aliens pumps up the stakes  and cameron directs it with professional quality  cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film  but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen  technically astonishing  aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed  aside from this  you probably wont experience anything like aliens for quite a while  ,1,1
307,as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on dday  the weary  seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat  they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen  one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck  as the flap falls  the battle begins  they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire  amid the chaos of this massacre  stands a shot that  at least for me  hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindlers list  a soldier  clearly missing an arm  wanders around the bodystrewn beach like a lost puppy  we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself  he bends over  picks up his arm and starts to carry it  probably not bothering to ask himself   what now   saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film  the direction is out of this world  surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar  the cinematography  by janusz kaminsky  is also astounding  but be forewarned  this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen  the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified  saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get  the question is   does the story and its realism justify the excessive use   the answer from my point of view is  no   braveheart was a truly gritty  and  one would imagine  realistic battle film  ryan is ten times worse  expect disembowelments  sucked in skulls  heads blown to bits  arms and legs flying across the battlefield  many in the theater could not bear to watch  and it is a shame  too  because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year  but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters  and academy members   saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on dday    through into the films primary mission  captain miller  hanks  assembles an  man crew and sets off to find a missing solider  private ryan  whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield  the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs  ryan doesnt recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons  that no person should suffer such injustice  millers crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan  though they dont yet know him  they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesnt have any more or less right to live than any of them  this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and  though there is a lot of set up between battles  the story continues full speed to the end  the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of its own  spielberg  though not a student of the  quick cut  school of filmmaking  takes a stab at it here  and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it  bay should pay close attention  take copious notes  if you want to jump cut every two seconds  do it the way spielberg does it in ryan  in the end  the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the  importance  of the film  schindlers list taught many people the truth about the holocaust  it opened eyes  sparked debate and study  though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before  they dont amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindlers list  overall  this is just the truest depiction of the old adage   war is hell   but braveheartdosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately  and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again  masterful work marred only by excessive gore  ,1,1
308,lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode   episode  is a boring  empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  after the familiar a long time ago      opening  the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo  ruled by queen amidala  portman  jedi knights quigon  neeson  and obi wan  mcgregor  are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade  however  this simple blockade is not all it seems  and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers  including facing the evil darth maul  ray park   they also meet the future darth vadar  anakin skywalker  jake lloyd  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking  script  direction and characters  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star  and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more nonexistent  theres no underlying tension  and no urgent need to see what the outcome is  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story  which doesnt help  theres no snap to make the film work  it moves at a plod  the script is boring  all the characters speak in morals  especially anakins mother  theres no group spirit evident here  and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders  its evident that not much is going to happen  the two leads are hideously boring  static characters given little to do and too much time to do it  quigon and obiwan hold no presence on film  and give little for the audience to root for  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul  if he had been given more screen time  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history  even if he does provide the only straight plot line in the film  all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy   anakin is annoying and unlikeable   instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended  its probably not surprising that his hateful little boy  unfortunately blessed ani by everyone he knows  joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks  although in the end none is provided in the film by him  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys  the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a pod racer  because i knew he wouldnt be able to talk for a while  queen amidala is a nothing in the film  she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people   and go googoo over anakin  again  her role will become more important in the later episodes  and is given little to do here  the actors dont help the movie much either  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed  and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy  with little charm  the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness  theres little other explanation for it  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script  but she delivers a spunky performance  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice  theres very little talent evident with him  its hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there  hes not even very cute   the main claim of the film  the special effects  are okay  theres nothing impressive about them  yet they complement the story well  the cgi takes away much of the human element  however  the battle droids for example  the replacement for the stormtroopers  are characterless little computer graphics  lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers  episode  is just disappointing  its got high production values  but little else  the music is meandering  except near the end  the plot gives us noone to root for  or even care for  the effects are nice  but dull  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should  theres an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair  and many clich  s are catered for throughout the film  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence  episode  is a dry affair that serves little purpose  except to make money and to get us to watch episode  to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film  disappointing is barely the word  rating ,0,0
309,capsule  the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie  the gags are sporadically funny  it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes  the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team  the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film  sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching  this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night    and it turns out he had very good reasons     low    to   a film needs a plot  it needs characters for empathy value  it needs a story and an emotional center  if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are  kevin smith has now made two satisfying films  clerks and chasing amy  with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp  peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled  but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it  his remaining two films  mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience  jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes  penis jokes  flatulence jokes  film pastiches  and injokes  how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call  for me  the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny  there was not enough cleverness or variety  it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay  penis jokes work only so many times  showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags  they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford  the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night  the lady vanishes  and passport to pimlico  jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners  as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts  in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads  jay and silent bob  played by jason mewes and kevin smith  are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks  this leaves them at loose ends  they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie  they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash  so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way  the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny  silent bob  being silent  can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his  this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have  jay has to be the comic  he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive  the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny  he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair  so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team  their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before  like dogma before it  but definitely not like chasing amy  this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie  certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving  they are excuses for gags  many of which still fall flat  it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content  the film does not offer much to an adult audience  i rate it  on the  to  scale and a low  on the  to  scale  ,0,0

311,it happens every year  the days get longer  the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their bigbudget blockbusters  this years crop already seems inferior to that of past summers  even s lackluster trio of batman  robin  the fifth element and the lost world  the marketing blitz in  has been centered on godzilla   heeere  leezerd  leezerd       which doesnt make me optimistic about future summers  godzilla is  of course  based on a series of cult movies  translation  really bad movies only a few people can tolerate  from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turnerowned cable stations  that this bigbudget remake wont rise above its roots is fairly obvious  the credits show us the origin of godzilla  in five words  nuclear explosion creates giant lizard  sounds like an enquirer headline  doesnt it  the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable  discovery  sequence  this time  a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling  if that aint a stereotype     when he discovers the telltale radar blip  people die  cut to our protagonist  played by matthew broderick  he makes his first appearance wearing headphones  warbling along to  singin in the rain   its a nonetoosubtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie  no dice  bueller  from the beginning  poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzillas enormous footprint  every disaster movie has to have a knowitall scientist  and this time broderick is it  as the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms  and wouldnt you love to have that printed on your business card    broderick is invaluable to the government  he immediately dispels vicki lewis theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because  hey  you cant take seriously the intellectual arguments of  newsradio  cast members  broderick instead hits the nail on the head  announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard    the radiation isnt an anamoly   he announces  and lightning strikes    i believe this is a mutated abberation   he continues  and lightning strikes again  its vocabulary lightning  you see  activated by words of four syllables or more  meanwhile  were introduced to our new york cast  headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist  maria patillo   brodericks former love  gee  what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time  poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  italian cameraman hank azaria tells her shes not ruthless enough   nice doesnt get you anywhere in this town  its dog eat dog   actually  its lizard eat city  as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apples core  the filmmakers provide us with a onenote drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla    i think ive got a bite   he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him  you can guess what happens next  similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city  hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps  one new yorker remarks   please dont tell me thats another parade   please dont tell me thats the best line you could come up with  mayor ebert is not pleased  played by the principal from  head of the class   he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option  and bickers with his assistant gene  i guess the filmmakers knew theyd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didnt even bother to kiss ass  the problem is  if youre going to attack siskel and ebert  you should at least make it funny  dialogue like   didnt we agree that we werent going to have any sweets until after the election   followed by   back off  gene   just doesnt work for me  other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick characters last name and frenchman jean renos inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york  theres even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses  as the beast heads back into hiding  broderick suggests the military lure it out with food  cue twelve dump trucks  all dropping fish into a new york intersection    broderick  thats a lot of fish   that ambush fails  but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying  worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them  yep  godzillas with children  which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla  thats until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually  like linda tripp  godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day  so it has a lot of dumb action scenes  destructive special effects and shallow subplots  look no further than patillos betrayal of broderick  patillo  what have i done  animal  what have i become   and the climactic  godzillas nest  sequence in madison square garden  the main difference is  independence day was about the experience  it had a real global  patriotic element to it  and some genuinely fun characters  godzilla has lots of rain and lightning  reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from

312,in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see  i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike  but in the case of american beauty  i must make an exception  if you havent yet seen it  go see it  now  stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex  then after youve seen it  come back  ill wait here  welcome back  if you followed my advice  and i see no reason why you should not have  do you    im sure youve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life  american beauty is an extraordinary film  a powerful  jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream  its humorous but it isnt funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production  mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended  and by god  it works  making it one of the years very best  lester burnham  kevin spacey  has entered the mother of all midlife crises  he is living life without a purpose  he is bored  depressed and sick of his sheltered  insignificant existence  he barely ever talks to his family  has no sex life  is stuck at a deadend job and thinks he has no reason to live  but one day  when he and his equally troubled wife  annette bening  attend one of his daughters  thora birch  cheerleading performances  he sees something that makes him come alive  what he sees is the performance by his daughters friend  the head cheerleader  he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl  an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature  but for the first time  lester feels that he is actually living  this crush is only the beginning  lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life  buying the car of his dreams  cursing off the boss and quitting his job   today i quit my job  told the boss to f    himself and blackmailed him for     would you pass the asparagus please     buying drugs from the voyeurnextdoor  ricky fitts  a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be  beauty   and refusing to be docile in family affairs  his new attitude further alienates his daughter  only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be  and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor  and the burnhamss neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum  ricky fitts  wes bentley  serves as the films thematic center  providing the obscure  powerful meaning of the title  colonel fitts  the father  is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie  even considering his limited screentime  kevin spacey has never been better  and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel  he never plays his droll character as a freak  rather  he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic selfexploration by his dissatisfaction with life  spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime  equally astonishing is young thora birch  who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness  at two hours and ten minutes  american beauty didnt feel nearly long enough  its a complicated  unforgettable film that  like the ice storm two years ago  dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life  powerfully and cynically  it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream  it claims that this pictureperfect image is just that  an image  and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it  the dark  deeply ironic ending  though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie  stays with you for weeks after its all over  american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released  even more so considering its a masterpiece  ,1,1
313,i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years  it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood  but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years  i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex  yes  more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me  trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster  for all teenagers  its almost like a rite of passage  and what we did was sometimes downright nasty  sometimes funny  and sometimes shocking  and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer  american pie is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year  just how great are their hormones raging  one of them notes  after watching disneys the little mermaid  that ariel is soooo hot  the four schoolmates are kevin  oz  finch and jim  kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend  but doesnt want to have sex until the time is just right  but what is the perfect time  there is just no way to know  and that frightens him  oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive  he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages  finch is the phobic hermit who doesnt stand a chance with any girl  so  he pays someone  to start spreading rumors about his prowess  suddenly  girls are lining up to go out with him  but among these friends  it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful  when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student  his inexperience comes shining through  he has much to learn  and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge  this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with moms apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking  raunchy  yet unbelievably funny  the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating  there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that theres something about mary was gloriously ribald  in fact  at first this film received a sinful nc rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teenaccessible rating  but i guess after seeing the noholdsbarred coarseness of south park  this seems tame by comparison  teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest  but unlike many teen sex comedies  there is a genuine intelligence at work here  these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex  their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences  they know what they want  yet temper it with responsibility  but almost always  its impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster  and its these episodes that make american pie such a carnal delight to watch  ,1,1
314,  payback   brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut  coincidentally  he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for s  l  a  confidential    is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence  death  and villainsand runs with it  or should i say  barely manages to crawl away with it  mel gibson  in yet another disappointing picture   conspiracy theory  and  lethal weapon    anyone    stars as the reprehensible villainhero  porter  a man who becomes determined to get his  share of     which he stole in a robbery  back when his partnerincrime  gregg henry  and drugaddicted wife  deborah kara unger  doublecross him  shoot him  and leave him for dead  porter is not dead  howevernot by a long shotas he quickly rehabilitates and  along with his loyal prositute girlfriend  rosie  maria bello   sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay  the tagline for  payback  is   get ready to root for the bad guy   and sure enough  this is true  as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way  i wouldnt have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest  but it wasnt  and therefore  i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever  no attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters  and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them  just because the protagonist  a  bad guy   is played by mel gibson doesnt mean i will  root for him   and i didnt  quite the contrary  every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death  although some of them did  anyway  just to spice up the dull proceedings   since none of the respectable actors in  payback  actually have human beings to play  only one performance managed to stand out  lucy alexis liu  of t  v  s  ally mcbeal    who plays a spicy sm dominatrix  brightens up every scene she is in  and has a definite flair for comedy  something i would have liked to have seen more of  since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  meanwhile  gibson  who is perfectly fine here  sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  unger  who made an impression in s  the game   is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in  and only has two purproses     to get high on heroin  and    because she plays a key part in an early flashback  finally  kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax  and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb  tellingly  he didnt appear in the original cut of the film  but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later   like most action movies  the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking  in the course of the minute running time of  payback   porter is shot three times in the back  hit by a van  beaten up  and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer  and guess what  not only does he survive the whole ordeal  but he is happygolucky in the penultimate sequence  and can still walk    even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag    payback  is not  in any way  an entertaining film  even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on  but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen  perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this  so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements  like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours  ,0,0

316,for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking  or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood  movie which are star vehicles are terrible things  as a rule  the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor  an actor might be chosen on the upandup  to give him exposure  or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck  generally  though  the actor doesnt matter  and soldier  the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers  exemplifies this  the picture lacks pizazz  the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell  otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less  russell plays todd  a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought  the movie lets us see this degenerate process  but by the time the real plot starts  were into todds later years  hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers  ones who  instead of being trained  from  birth  are genetically selected  before  birth  the pride of this class  caine   jason scott lee   will be our villain  and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start  between the two leads  less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken  and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction  director paul anderson  who helmed last years icy thriller  event horizon  doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam  todd  upon being replaced  is left to die on a garbage planet  but in order to stretch the running time out  the villains return to the garbage planet on a  routine patrol  and set the stage for the final firefight  events are predictable from the time that the setups are made  and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here  the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be  todd fails to show physical superiority against caine  in fact  not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie  but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry  its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story  and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it  the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit  and treat it as a parody of typical action fare  like universal soldier  a strict interpretation  however  reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style  class  or substance  and by next year  a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television  ,0,0
317,  when you get out of jail  you can kill him   starring ashley judd  tommy lee jones  bruce greenwood  rated r  double jeopardy is a lurid  prepostrous thriller thats also one of the years most enjoyable  its an uncompromisingly brutal  cheerfully anarchic  hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  there is not a moment here when the events on screen dont have a direct bearing on the plot  once the film gets going it never stops  it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and thats probably a correct assessment of the plot  but the film itself has little in common with the  andrew davisharrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  not even bothering with character introduction  director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the getgo and never finds the brake  we meet  rather hastily  libby and nick parsons  ashley judd and bruce greenwood  respectively  a seemingly happy married couple  with a son matty  age   they go out on a sailboat one night  and after a period of some rockin sex  they go to sleep  libby hears a strange noise  wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  she follows a red trail to the upper deck  where she finds a knife and  out of astonishment  picks it up  at that convenient moment  the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  her lawyer  a friend  puts up a defense in court  but though we know she is innocent  the evidence against her is too compelling  her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  once in prison  she makes a phone call to her friend  her friend gives her son the phone  nick walks in the room  little matty screams  daddy   the phone goes dead  libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isnt even dead  she gets some advice from a prisonerformer lawyer  who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband  they cant convict her of the same crime again  meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they cant touch her  after a weirdly short amount of time  she gets out of parole  she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees  under the command of parole officer travis lehman  tommy lee jones   she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back  which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated  she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her sons  adopter   double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false  the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime  same time  same place  same circumstances  its not like it matters  this is a rollickingly good thriller  intense  exciting  fast and furious  its silly alright  but this is the kind of film you just dont question  in some films  plausibility is everything  double jeopardy  however  is not concerned with making sense  its sole purpose is to entertain  and it does  judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role  this is her breakout boxoffice performance  and she is terrific  she brings some emotion to what could have been a onedimensional role  giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces  tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive  but the movie makes good use of his stonefaced wit  thankfully  too  double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis  a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the films story  this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys  and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that  the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful  as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book  after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops  deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system  its great to see a movie that doesnt so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure  double jeopardy is really good  but it isnt the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards  its one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off  otherwise  your brain will be busy ruining your experience  this is a thriller that isnt concerned with being smart or plausible  instead it diverts all attention to the action  which  this year  is second to none  ,1,0
318,much ado about nothing  ah  how sweet the irony  its accepted wisdom in some circles  among english literature nuts  mainly  that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance  he just doesnt  understand  shakespeare  you will hear them say  the bards work is apparently beyond criticism  what a load of old cobblers  if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaughs film of shakespeares  comedy  much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word  its time to get a life  get monty python  get woody allen  get john waters  whatever  just get a real taste of some clever  witty  risky comedy  and banish this nonsense to where it belongs  drama and tragedy was shakespeares strength  to my sensibilities  and im no stick in the mud  much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever  no kidding  this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my  years of movie going  the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend  as this was our day out and i hadnt seen her in ages  but boy  does she owe me one  i wont spend too much time on the plot  basically  we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples  one young  the other older  theres some dark treachery amongst all this  but everyone is so awfully jolly that youd hardly know it  mind you  theres nothing wrong with the basic story  good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound  nothing wrong with most of the cast  either  branaugh  emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers  the problem is the script  or more accurately  shakespeares original text  light comedy shouldnt be complex  yet wrapped in elizabethan english  the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend  for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good  undemanding laugh  the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves  the actor once again miscast as a jealous halfbrother or something  but when dissected and understood  what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame  this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold  ho  ho  ho  boy likes girl  ho  ho  ho  men are such klutzes  ho  ho  ho  shes so awfully clumsy  oh please  theres wit in here somewhere  im told  i call it pretentious  something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay  in the end  its cringeworthy  watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience  comedy  bah  humbug  ,0,0
319,one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy  innocent fun  sometimes the stories are compelling  sometimes theyre not  but  with the exception of the first film in the series  which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces   ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions  star trek  insurrection is no exception  the film has gotten some negative reviews  a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series   but im not really sure why  its an exciting  often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film  some say its a bit too light  and more of a long episode than a film  others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring  i simply enjoyed the film  insurrection  which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast  introduces us to a race of people called the baku  the baku are very old  most of them are about three hundred years old   but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet  of course  these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves  leave it up to their archenemies  the sona  led by ruafo  f  murray abraham   to mess everything up  the sona  who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable  strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying  thats when captain picard  patrick stewart  steps in  he realizes that moving the baku would kill them  it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman  donna murphy    so  with his trusty crew  picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat  when dealing with a series with as much history as this  its not entirely necessary to reintroduce your characters with each episode  this is why i believe nonfans have a hard time getting into star trek  in order to enjoy it  one has to understand how to approach it  insurrection  however  does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters  stewart is bold as always  a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together  jonathan frakes  who also directed  is funny as commander riker  a subplot with data  brent spiner  discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting  and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain  overacting like crazy  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact  insurrection is an exciting film  with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation  and the result is very pleasing to the eye  particularly in the climactic scenes  in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet  the special effects have a clean  impressively sharp look  if i have any complaint about the film  its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so  i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move  baku in order to save the lives of thousands  better yet  why couldnt they have coexisted  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience  with its inherent camp factor  the star trek series doesnt seem wellequipped to deal with issues like this  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle  ,1,0

323,films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success  whether theyre about superheroes  batman  superman  spawn   or geared toward kids  casper  or the arthouse crowd  ghost world   but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before  for starters  it was created by alan moore  and eddie campbell   who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid s with a part series called the watchmen  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd  the book  or  graphic novel   if you will  is over  pages long and includes nearly  more that consist of nothing but footnotes  in other words  dont dismiss this film because of its source  if you can get past the whole comic book thing  you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors  albert and allen hughes  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in  well  anything  but riddle me this  who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society  the ghetto in question is  of course  whitechapel in  londons east end  its a filthy  sooty place where the whores  called  unfortunates   are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision  when the first stiff turns up  copper peter godley  robbie coltrane  the world is not enough  calls in inspector frederick abberline  johnny depp  blow  to crack the case  abberline  a widower  has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium  upon arriving in whitechapel  he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly  heather graham  say it isnt so  and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach  i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper  so i wont go into the particulars here  other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay  in the comic  they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper  but screenwriters terry hayes  vertical limit  and rafael yglesias  les mis  rables  do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end  its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because  after all  an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts  and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days   who holds back the electric carwho made steve guttenberg a star     dont worry  itll all make sense when you see it  now onto from hells appearance  its certainly dark and bleak enough  and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did  at times  it seems like sleepy hollow    the print i saw wasnt completely finished  both color and music had not been finalized  so no comments about marilyn manson   but cinematographer peter deming  dont say a word  ably captures the dreariness of victorianera london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks  even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the blackandwhite comic  oscar winner martin childs  shakespeare in love  production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place  even the acting in from hell is solid  with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent  ians holm  joe goulds secret  and richardson   dalmatians  log in great supporting roles  but the big surprise here is graham  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth  imagining her attempt at an irish accent  but it actually wasnt half bad  the film  however  is all good      r for strong violencegore  sexuality  language and drug content ,1,0
324,near the end of   analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king  the following year    saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom  twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia  at best  thats all it was  a sleeper hit  designed to surprise but not shake the industry  in   however  things have been decidedly different  there have been a number of pushes on disneys death grip on the market  and fiftyone weeks into   a new champion has emerged  dreamworks the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed  the other two contenders  warner brothers quest for camelot and disneys own annual entry  mulan  lacked inspiration and drive respectively  although camelot was borderlineabysmal  and cant really be considered a shot at the title  mulan had the makings of winner  unfortunately  it was saturated with traditional  disneycute animation  and lost points against the rapidlychanging face of the competition  in making the prince of egypt  dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product  the animation is flawless  and  aside from a bugs life  is the bestlooking movie to date  the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects  and the dd combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with  the key to success  however  was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot  namely  some of the most important action sequences  like the parting of the red sea  were done almost entirely in d  dreamworks is the first studio to prove that theyve got the stuff of success  and that theyre capable of challenging disney  the story is also wellwritten  and the characters voiced with talent  for the most part  the plot follows its source material  the book of exodus  although only in the most general sense  the writers took a few creative liberties  and most do not damage the story in any way  in fact  the shakespearean relationship between moses  val kilmer  and the pharaoh rameses  ralph fiennes  makes the story more interesting if anything  moses  a hebrew  is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile  he floats into the pharaoh seti  patrick stewart  s palace and is taken in by the royal family  moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert  where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves  by this time  rameses is now pharaoh  and the two brothers  now on opposite sides of the line  face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention  the cast of voices is most impressive  and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock  jeff goldblum  danny glover  and steve martin  the script does not have a lot of oneliners in it  and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams  but overall the story is exciting and interesting  its decidedly for an older crowd  and the tykes who havent had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost  but for those who make the bid  the prince of egypt can be a great watch  ,1,1
325,the year is  and the military is conducting nuclear testings  involved in these tests is hank marshall  jones   an army colonel who is critical of the aboveground tests that are being done  he urges belowground tests which no one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own  marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly  lange  who is topless on the bases beach in full view of the entire personnel  hanks reaction is one of amusement  hes been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how  the problem is carly is a manicdepressive and when she isnt flirting with any man who happens to be near her  shes fantasizing about a fictious world where shed rather be  typical of the mental illness  she also is promiscuous and foultempered  the mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable  from hanks reports which state his opposition to the armys methods of testing  he is transferred from hawaii to alabama  carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe  bleachblond and all  the new home in alabama is pretty rundown and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum  after meeting his new commanding officer  booth   hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat  carly openly flirts with the co  hank tries to deal with the situation  but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool  arguments ensue  the family becomes even more alienated  the co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers  much to the vocal objections of hank  who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb  back at home  the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father cant deal with their mothers problems  one daughter says   hes blind and shes crazy   the other answers   theyre perfect for each other   it reaches the breaking point when the older girl  locane  and a boy  the cos son  odonnell  see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed  she forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open  hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives  including the cos wife  snodgress   he confronts the c  o  but not about carly  he is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing  a fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not being able to satisfy his wife  hank is arrested  what follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co  he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation  instead  they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely cope  he foams at the mouth and cannot even finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters  carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time  the film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems  the performances are solid throughout  jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wifes rage  he comforts her and offers protection  lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family  amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should  blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family  the screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner  with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling   the film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in   he had made such classics as look back in anger    and tom jones     orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years  the film joins an alread promising fall lineup of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone  ,1,1
326,just look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski  change the actors  take away the bowling alley  add a record store  and youve got high fidelity  or maybe the other way around since nick hornbys novel high fidelity came first   either way  its been done before  a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances  yet it remains consistently funny  why is this  maybe because you know your life is much better than this  you know these guys are more pathetic than you are  and you know its ok to laugh at them because theyre fictional  director stephen frears  possibly not intentionally  has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day  when watching high fidelity  expect to laugh at someone elses pain  realize what you are laughing at  and then laugh again  i laughed at dick  todd louiso   the shy  timorous  steve buscemi character of lebowski  who seems to know what he is talking about but either cant put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends  i laughed at the john goodman character barry  jack black   an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons  pudgy  egotistic  and obnoxious at the same time  and i laughed at rob  john cusack   the jeff bridges type  whom the story revolves around  rob is the character easiest to relate to  but he is nothing like you at all  he uncontrollably cheats and lies  then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman  and like his other miserable friends  pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort  he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it  whatever human emotions the clash  aretha franklin  and bruce springsteen records hold  rob and co  grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives  rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in  during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on  rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him  but these arent any girlfriends  these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob  robs incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life   the plot in three words is  women and music  the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective  it gives high fidelity a quickly paced  informal structure  adjectives which perfectly parallel robs own lifestyle  it also helps open the viewers eyes as to how annoying barry is  jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball  just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob  who must work with him every day of the week  what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes  john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast  consisting of big stars and character actors  that really defines rob  now instead of rob just talking to the camera  after he explains something  the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say  the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesnt end when it should have ended  instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that  also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie  high fidelity is a cheerful  old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs  i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen  they make everyone look and feel great  ,1,0
327,virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre  since dark city     films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another  the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix  all the films released after it  have been less successful  david cronenbergs existenz  released only a couple of months after the matrix  was accepted and even appreciated  by some   but the hype was gone  and when the thirteenth floor aired this fall  it was completely overseen and ignored  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying  feeling like eating the same meal over and over again  it was therefore i was less than excited  when i went out to see to the thirteenth floor  however  i was positively surprised by josef rusnaks latest picture  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality  combining the best of hollywoods action and effects with an intelligent story  existenz was a violent  gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality  ending in blood and madness  the thirteenth floor is somewhere in between  instead of going after the crowds  the action audience  like the matrix   or aiming at the horror fans  like existenz   the thirteenth floor presents a more intelligent plot  witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience  that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding  in a near future    on the thirteenth floor of a classified building  a genius scientist  hannon fuller  has created a simulated world  his personal dreamworld  where every inhabitant is a complex  selflearning program that only believes it is real  right after the first testing of this world  fuller   is found murdered  douglas hall    his closest friend and business partner  immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth  a beautiful woman  gretchen mol  who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery  which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence  the first  download into simulation  is impressive  it is the creators first visit to his world  his creation  in order to enter this virtual universe  you have to take over someones identity  become another person  this is called conciseness transfer  and this is part of the tragedy in the film  people  wake up  in unknown places and strange things start happen  they start to doubt in their own sanity  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their  users  and creators with their sanity and their lives  it is a frightening reality  the fact that all the people in the simulation  the program links  are living out their lives  oblivious  not knowing that they are puppets in someones fantasy  with an appealing   blade runner   type  of detective story  this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present  our modern world is metal and glass  cold  unfriendly  impersonal  the thirties are different  colorful  beautiful  elegant  virile  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical  enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise  to some a personal playground  a life without any consequences  for others  a way to start over and  correct  their mistakes  by living in an illusion of their past  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes  dreams and fantasies to life  at least thats how it is all beginning  but when youre waking up from your dream  the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise  this  almost narcotic effect  soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised  what is real  what is thought  who are we  if these were answered  this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made  they are off course not answered  but posed in an intelligent manner  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements  since it portrays the contrast between these computersimulated universes  kirk m  petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour  grace and color  and setting this world in opposition to our own  an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald kloses moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time  a rather unusual thing aboutthe thirteenth floor is the almost complete lack of special effects  there are no cgi animated creatures  no bullets in slow motion  this is a more philosophical approach  reminding about the european way of filmmaking  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians  but the more serious science fiction buffs and dark cityfans will be pleased  this film is interesting and inspiring  it has everything existenz doesnt  but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix  and then there is a happy end which  like in dark city  completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think  since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics  including blade runner and dark city  with this in mind  the thirteenth floor doesnt make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now  yet this is a beautiful  elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality  ,1,1
328,billed as a  feminist sex fantasy   this spirited  imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the awardwinning canadian director cynthia roberts  is destined for extreme reactions  camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heartfelt tale of the title character bubbles galore  nina hartley   a pornactressturnedpornproducer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence  however  those in the andrea dworkin camp  will no doubt loathe the films decidedly proporn stance  political considerations aside  however  this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers  shauny sexton   in the backdrop  however is bubbles loyal assistant vivian klitorsky  tracy wright  who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss  this femmebutchfemme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity  and  sensuality  in addition to the romantic aspects of the story  bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her exboyfriend godfrey montana  daniel macivor   a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it  when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through  he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her  these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence  god herself  yes  in the world of this film  god  is most definitely a  her   and a chorus of undulating  scantilyclad angels  have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold  adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction  this bright  colourful and deliriously sexy film is chockfull of great performances  making her dramatic debut  after appearing in over  triple x adult films  porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary straight actresses to shame  hartley has overwhelming star power  and one wonders why other nontriplex producers havent used her bountiful talents  it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of  boogie nights   a film which takes a far more traditional doomandgloom approach to the porn industry  making a cameo appearance in the role of god  former porn actress annie sprinkle  a true artist in her own right  gives the entire film an earthy  sensual glow and certainly solidifies and  by her very appearance  downright justifies the themes of the movie  the other performances are equally solid  daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role  shauny sexton  an erotic dancer and pinup model  makes an impressive screen debut  overall  bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed  at one point  the title character declares that  instead of trying to save women from the sex trade  we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work   the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive  roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straightahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avantgarde montage sequences  the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful  the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings  while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish s porn and psychedelia  amazingly  this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies  this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture  as one cannot imagine such an entertaining  original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day  bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not  at present  appear to have any traditional distribution in place  so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one  its funny  sexy and subversive  and it shouldnt be missed  ,1,1

occur  dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road  whos on the up and up  whos the real bad guy and whos gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie  critique  the funnest movie that ive seen so far this year  its got style  its got tough guys talkin shite and its got plenty of bullets to go around  a definite hunkahunka burnin adventure  a guys guy movie through and through  and one thatll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff  its not very original  it goes on for a little too long  but costner and russell make it happen  as two shitekickin elvis lovers  who dont stop till they  more or less  drop  this movies got some pretty intensive shootout scenes  one of the coolest robbery scenarios that ive ever witnessed  featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the kings music playing in the background  and a decent helping of doublecrosses  sharp dialogue and funny moments  in fact  even though the cast is filled with many name actors  bactors as they might be for the most part   most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim  but the true glue that holds this film together  other than the spirit of elvis himself  is costner and russell  who play their badass characters to the t  sure  russells been down this road before  but costner surprised me with his nastiness  i guess hes pissed at all the boxoffice bombs that hes been in of late  but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here  in the end  the bottom line with this movie is having fun  kickin ass and making sure theres enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards  and smoke em if you got em  folks  there is also this one really great showdown scene between costner and a cop  thatll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time  the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack thatll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next  it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background  with plenty  and i mean plenty  of camera tricks  cuts and edits  but for this kind of flick  it actually works  the film is not perfect though  it starts off with a pretty big bang  but then pulls a way of the gun on us  and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle  while characters intermingle and disperse  i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots  and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well  and did i mention that courteney cox looked megahot in the movie  no    okay  well i just did  i coulda done without her whole  romance  angle  but to be honest  it doesnt take up much of the film  which is generally covered in blood  explosions  guts and elvis nods  try to see how many  inside  connections to the king you can guess  of course  its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind  i also like these types of  guy  movies a lot  and even though the film doesnt bring much originality to the table  it does offer a pretty coherent story  some nice twists and turns  humor and a big ol helping of whoopass coming straight from costner and russells respective boots  probably not a film for everyone  but definitely for those who enjoy the guns  the charismatic bad guys and a fun  if entirely disposable  adventure  now see how many elvis songs ive used to pun my way through this phony review below  the elvis songs also recommend this movie  so whether youre lonesome tonight or any other night  remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets  leave your little sister at home  bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse  cause this movie aint one to return to the sender  i really beg of you  whether youre stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel  to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender  and no suspicious minds either  folks  cause i got stung by this movie  i mean it really shook me up  and unless youre the devil in disguise himself  i think you wont be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either  so dont be cruel  dont turn away  dont curl up with your latest flame tonite  whether she be a hardheaded woman or not  and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film  its now or never  folks  trust me  i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that id seen so far this year is far behind me  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building  thank you    thank you very much   wheres joblo coming from  get carter     heat     honeymoon in vegas     payback     reindeer games    reservoir dogs     way of the gun    ,1,1
332,therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start  recommendation  turn off your brain  dont be like me  decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  a comet is about to strike earth  causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event  e  l  e   that wiped out the dinosaurs  what follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people  a rising reporter  the love story of two teenagers  one of whom discovered the comet   and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world  firstly  there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film  nor is there anything outstandingly good about it   but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  to be honest  i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself  which isnt saying much   mimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent  with all the big stars wasted    perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller  the assignment   it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision  but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives  however  the film simply fails on that note  the effects are wornout  the substandard screenplay limited the acting  and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials  shes still making good money though  t  a leonis unfortunate character  the news reporter  is the foundation of the story and of the cast  but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored  robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless  and morgan freemans president is restricted to  well  a righteous president  which means hes not interesting at all   leonis character is the only appealing one  and is played with reasonable conviction  but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc   but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters  warning  spoilers included  but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway   plot holes  plot holes  plot holes  now  e  l  e  is threatening to exterminate more than  of the human race  and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there  wheres the logic  leder could have at least made it plausible with   and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish  and those less selfish ones  the ones that stayed at home  were the victims  the film was almost mocking them  telling them they had died for nothing  i also fail to see how two teenagers  carrying a baby  would be the first to climb up the mountainhill  even with a motorbike for a headstart  its unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle  but that doesnt really matter  building caves was a strategy mentioned in dr  strangelove  which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years  now that is a more practical use for caves  what is the point of living in caves  there is no  unlike dr  strangelove  any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure  how do plants grow  if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves  theres no reason why they cant do it in the open  the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves  obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago  and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media  in an important mission like that of the messiah  for that matter any mission  it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres  needless to say tens of kilometres  this is not deep impact  its a frivolous cheap impact  but even with all that  some overacting  and a    rating  its still watchable  just dont think about it  okay  ,0,0
333,gordie boggs  arquette  aptly cast as a moron  as he is one  and his best friend sean dawkins  scott caan  the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this   are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends  who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king  a terribly casted oliver platt   as he is everything they are not  they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil  ruthless promoter titus sinclair  a wasted palitaliano  in a role originally meant for reallife wcw president eric bischoff  whose name was written all over the role    gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him  but a drunken  ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry  darryl  and darryl  they sneak him back onto wcw tv  after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcws next payperview  against his rival  diamond dallas page  if he wins  king gets his title and his career back  plus one million dollars  wcw president eric bischoff  knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation  came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw  he was then fired and rehired two months ago  but by the time hed left  they had already been contracted to do the film  and bischoff could not play sinclair  which  in itself  is for the best  as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor    the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans  he thinks of them as young  dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real  that is why he doesnt take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a payperview  i have news for you  eric  no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isnt for show  unless they are four years old  this is   you know  not   bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy  but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic  rockystyle film  which it probably should have been  professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is  why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy    gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light  anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows  documenting wwf owner vince mcmahons doublecrossing of bret hart  will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble  that it is basically a ripoff of that films storyline with the poor mans wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect  you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince  but any selfrespecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince  and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart  all of these aspects of the film  needless to say  seriously offended me as a wrestling fan  another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha  the lovely rose mcgowan   wouldnt it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclairs insistance  i hate that cliche  the world wrestling federation would have made a better film  they are the promotion everyone cares about  they are winning the ratings  they have better wrestlers  and they take their fans into consideration and dont treat fans like morons  so  vince  how about a movie  ,0,0

335,have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally  at any given moment  in life  or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world  or outside of it  these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of  final destination   which is the most riveting horrordrama since s  the sixth sense   stylishly filmed and tautly directed by  xfiles  alum james wong  the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters  in accurately written  teenspeak   rather than overwrought  highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldnt use   all the while developing into a darkly foreboding  severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful  but still suspenseful epilogue  at the start of the film  yearold high school senior alex browning  devon sawa  is about to leave with his student french class for a field trip to paris  progressively getting a case of preflight jitters  he spots several mysterious  coincidences   including the departure time being     the same as his september  birthday  as well as hearing the john denver song  rocky mountain high  over the sound system in the airport bathroom    john denver died in a plane crash   alex grudgingly mutters to himself  once seated  alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff  and after causing a ruckus onboard  he  as well as six other students and a teacher  are thrown off  arguing in the airport lobby  alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight  killing all  passengers  including the rest of their classmates  as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode  the fellow survivors  whom he has saved  treat him in varying manners  carter  kerr smith   the hotshot jock  holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate  alexs best friend  tod  chad e  donella   wants to stand by him but cant because of his fearful parents  the teacher  mrs  lewton  kristen cloke   is frightened by him  believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster  as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker  only outsider clear rivers  ali larter   who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before  is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life  that is only the setup of  final destination   and the less said about what follows  the better  suffice to say  the film does  indeed  turn into a slasher film  albeit one that is more thoughtful than most  and replaces a knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all  the grim reaper itself  the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes  and  final destination  surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years  graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner  they manage to occasionally be so intense you dont know whether to shrink down in your seat  tap your feet in nervousness  or turn away  devon sawa  a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in s underseen slashercomedy   idle hands   is even more of a charismatic presence here  the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival  which he comes to believe he wasnt meant to do  as well as the loss of the other passengers  is superbly and subtly acted on his part  one scene  in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful  ali larter  s  varsity blues    in the other central role  is also effective  as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before  leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father  the other roles are not as fully written  and most remain rather onedimensional  the movie is mainly sawas  however  and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles  tony todd  s  candyman    as an arcane morgue attendant  pops up for a fiveminute cameo  but his appearance is rather supererogatory  and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye  while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy  ultimately  what is so good about  final destination  is that  within the confines of the slasher genre  writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner  and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films  if anything  its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again  ,1,1
336,if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film  it was studio   the late steve rubells infamous new york discotheque  which came to symbolize the taboosmashing excesses of the disco eras heyday  easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone  all set to a thumping dance beat  so when miramax started production on  last year  the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began  an edgy film as downanddirty as the club itself  written and directed by a promising firsttimer  mark christopher  and starring some hot young talent  salma hayek  neve campbell  newcomer ryan phillippe  and mike myers in his dramatic debut   my  how easily does the worm turn  hype turned into damage control when word got out about thhour reshoots  wrapped only a month ago   a rash of studioimposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew  especially christopher  unhappy  and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics  at the last minute  though  miramax did decide to screen the film  so hastily scheduled was the screening that myerss last name was misspelled on the invitation  not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes  for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed  myself included  and with good reasonsomehow  some way  the supremely disappointing  has made the historically hip haven of hedonism    boring  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film  he still must shoulder some of the blame for s lifelessness   focuses  for the most part  on a tightknit trio of employees at the club  coat check girlaspiring disco diva anita  a wasted hayek   her busboy husband  greg  breckin meyer   and  most prominently  the freshfromjersey shane oshea  phillippe   who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions  in focusing on the hired help  christopher really missed the boat  with the exception of the flamboyant  alwayswoozy rubell  myers  in a wellmodulated turn   the meaty stories to be told at studio  are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party  not necessarily the numerous vip guests  but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the clubs famously hardass doormen and dance  among other things  the night away with the rich  famous  and infamous  the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dows feisty dottie  a disco and drugcrazed granny  but shes a peripheral character at best   as such  aside from the expected overhead crowd shots  there is precious little actual dancing in   what is a disco filmespecially one about the pinnacle of the movementwithout the dancing  even whit stillmans thelastdaysofdisco  which wasnt so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hiptoonlythemselves clubhopping preppies  featured at least one extended dance scene  dancing isnt the only thing glazed over in so is the sex  but that may not be entirely christophers fault  from what ive heard  his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring  starting with the shane character  he was conceived  and actually filmed  as a wild  morally ambiguous bisexual  which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio s legend  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut  shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out  consequently  so was the film  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film  shanes fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie  sela ward   and an abbreviated bedhopping montage  the sexual dimension is just about ignored  shane  in this incarnation  is sanitized to the point of blandness  an idealistic dogooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club  julie black  campbell   a worldly soap star with  yes  a heart of gold  this tackedon  romance  would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience  they fail on both counts  ultimately  s failure comes down to three letters  fun  as in  there isnt any to be had for the audience  too much time is spent with the boring shane  and too little is spent on the club floor  where all the action took place  anyhow  though  whatever time is spent on the  floor is not used very effectively  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club  it should be a euphoric height  for her  the crowd  and the audience  however  the moment doesnt get a chance to reach that level  for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality  which also mars the films conclusion  one of the lastminute reshoots   strangely upbeat and wistful  the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying  there is an interesting portrait of studio  out theretwo of them  in factbut  is not one of them  theyre on cable tv  a couple of documentaries produced by e  and vh  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goingson within it show that theres still a great disco movie to be made  the problem is  after the critical and certain box office failure of   the subject may have run its hollywood course  ,0,0
337,theres a good  and timely  story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first  a new movie about the abuses of our prison system  with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy  this expose would offer something rare to recent american moviesa point of view  but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious  often nauseating  camera movements and slick  mtv style lighting and editing are far more important  theres not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling  and everything suffers  christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate  respectively  after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape  bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial  his young lawyer  slater  is fresh out of law school but determined to  put alcatraz on trial  for the abuses of it warden  gary oldman   the result is the usual courtroom theatrics imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students  theres very little to praise here outside of kevin bacons earnest overacting and the appropriate story  theres a lot of overacting from everyoneyou know youre in trouble right away when r  lee ermey  the drill sergeant in full metal jacket  is cast as a judge  the center of reason and moderation  slater has never been convincing and certainly isnt here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances  but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story  there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters  let alone with them  how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions  if theres anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world  it is our ability to tell a good story  have we forgotten  ,0,0

341,mr  nice guy is the latest jackie chan film  so you should know what to expect  a weak plot  terrible dialogue  very little acting ability  but some jawdropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile  however  mr  nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackies best efforts  and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever  jackie chan plays  who else  jackie  this time out  hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  not that it ever makes a difference in the plot  there are only two scenes of him cooking  for the rest of the film  somehow he mutates into jackie chan  supercop  it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills    perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege  a tv newswoman  diana  gabrielle fitzpatrick   covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo  richard norton  and a local gang of toughs  the demons  although she only has one camcorder  somehow the result is full of closeups and multiple angles    hmmm  shades of broadcast news    anyway  the goons discover diana  and will do anything to recover the tape  here lies another crucial flaw in the story  doesnt anyone realize you can copy a tape  oh well  no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense  as luck would have it  diana runs across jackie  and  wouldnt you know it  jackie accidentally ends up with the tape  this leads to countless chase andor fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie  in a move apparently designed to woo american  and other englishspeaking  audiences  the film uses english as its primary language  however  that doesnt mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackies recent americanized releases  strangely  many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english  and poorly too  whether this is just a very bad case of looping  an effort to minimize accents  or a simple case of nostalgia  it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackies dubbed films  the plot in mr  nice guy is negligible  merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons  but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackies films  it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread  look  if you have jackie chan playing a chef  why not use that to your advantage  watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen  beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts  the action is a mixed bag here  theres really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackies films  it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan  the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst  but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes  the films gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting  once or twice  it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence  but to slomo jackie running  either this is a nod to the sixmillion dollar man  or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down  if youve seen all of jackies films and are in need of another fix  go ahead and see mr  nice guy  however  if youre just in the mood for some good action  youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  such as supercop  ,0,1

343,after the press screening of  moulin rouge   i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues  everyone seemed a bit numb  understandable after sitting through a barrage of oftenincongruous sounds and images  a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it  another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production  while a woman who flatout hated the movie gave him the skunk eye  when one fellow quietly stated  ive never really been a fan of musicals   the statement surprised me because  even though the story is told almost completely through song  i didnt think of it as a musical  there is so much going on in  moulin rouge  that  musical  seems too small a term to cover it    moulin rouge  is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience  australian director baz luhrmann  the man behind  strictly ballroom  and  romeo  juliet   fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork  opulent imagery and songs ranging from  the sound of music  to  smells like teen spirit   sumptuous and beautiful  vulgar and overdone   moulin rogue  travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with  years worth of catchy tunes operates on the  random  setting  oh  and it has a story as well    it was   the summer of love      christian  ewan mcgregor  is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris   to write about truth  beauty  freedom and love   where he encounters a group of bohemians  led by henri de toulouselautrec  john leguizamo   christian meets satine  nicole kidman   a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue  and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor  at once fragile and vivacious  the dazzling redhaired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying  christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well  which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession  working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler  jim broadbent   christian writes an opus modestly named  spectacular spectacular   zidler quickly finds a backer  the wealthy duke of monroth  richard roxburgh   but theres a catch  the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine  as if all that isnt enough  satine has a cough  and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold  it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land  like a teetertotter   moulin rogue  moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime  one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night  becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales  together they dance  while serenaded by the man in the moon  alessandro safina provides the vocals   apparently transported from the classic georges m  li  s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky  other scenes merely traffic in everythingandthekitchensink overload  the cavorting of toulouselautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy  accompanied by cartoon sound effects  is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like  bewitched  beat into the ground  of course  sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind    we never heard from baz to turn it down   one of the actors told the los angeles times    it was always  more  more    the director even sent a note to his cast reading   i dare you to make me say youve gone too far   the musical numbers reflect his attitude  one knockout piece  the  elephant love medley   incorporates the beatles  all you need is love   us  in the name of love   dolly partons  i will always love you  and elton john and bernie taupins  your song   need more  how about  diamonds are a girls best friend  spiced with portions of  material girl   luhrmanns cast offers a wide variety of approaches that  together  add up to something messy  but often wonderful  ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian  emphasizing the sincerity of the lovestruck poet  mcgregors singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments  once labeled the  ice queen   nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling  yet tender  performance  she handles the songs adroitly  although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range  veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler  wait until you see him perform  like a virgin   as the buffoonish duke  richard roxburgh proves to be the films weakest link  although im sure he was simply following instructions  i suspect  moulin rogue  will be one of those loveitorhateit films  while i didnt completely love it  i most certainly liked it a lot  over the course of a year  i see well over  movies  and most of them look like xeroxes of each other    moulin rogue  is an original  and an original  even a flawed one  is a thing to be cherished  ,1,1
344,heres a concept  jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie  now if that isnt enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie  i dont know what is  all sarcasm aside  it is certainly a different way to start a movie  of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother  so lucky us  we get to see more of jeanclaude  van damme  works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives  van damme  is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after  gets killed in france  the remaining twin  the french cop  goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death  once there  he hooks up with his deceased brothers girlfriend  played by natasha henstridge  and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are  jeanclaudes acting abilities dont seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie  in other words  just in case you missed the sarcasm  his acting is worse than normal  on the upside  natasha henstridge is in this film  and she does what she did best in species  she gets naked  sadly  this is probably the high point in the movie  she is actually a decent actress  but didnt improve as much as i thought she would after species  this is the typical van damme movie  with jeanclaude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents  nothing new here  and certainly nothing we havent seen in every other van damme movie  simply put  there is absolutely nothing new about this movie  it has a retread plot  this isnt the first time jeanclaude has played twins  he still cant act  we all saw natashas breasts in species  although this is one repeat performance im not complaining about   this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in  sub par  ,0,0
345,dark city is such a rare treat  it  s a stunning  hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir  science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london  to boot  it is accompanied by an intense  well written and thoughtful story  movies of this caliber and idea aren  t made too often  and it  s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it  alex proyas  who  s previous film the crow looked good but couldn  t cover up the terrible acting or story  here shows a near masterpiece  a combination of metropolis  edward hopper and phillip marlowe  fused seemlessly  at times it moves beyond film into artwork  it is the story of  strangers   aliens from another planet  and we know they  re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats  one of the detractions of the film  who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live  what makes up our  soul   these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the  ultimate technology  of shaping matter with their mind  called  tuning  they are aided by a human scientist  played by kiefer sutherland  who has  betrayed his kind  and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight  during this time  john murdoch  played swiftly by rufus sewell  wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light  a terrific visual effect  not only is murdoch confused  but so is the audience   without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer  he receives a phone call to flee  as the strangers are after him  i don  t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story  one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop  in a way regaining murdoch  s  identity  along with him  it  s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography  murdoch  s wife  anna  is introduced through a stunning beam of light  she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight  shadows  outlines of men in hats watch  as she gently curves through the shine  we see the outline of her body from behind  an hourglass  as she sings a slow  rhythmic song  a great entrance  however  a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied  the city is nice to look at  but if it  s a poor story then it  s not worth watching  blade runner was popular not only because it  s visuals  but it  s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience  it is discussed it and argued  therefore a success  other science fiction films of recent times  such as the fifth element  are nice to look at  but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy  we  re left with  love conquers all  after finishing the fifth element  dark city is not so easily explained away  as the strangers discovered  locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task  where is reality  dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the   s  and ranks along with the best made in the s  such as blade runner and the two aliens films  perhaps it  s the best of the both decades  it had the darkness of the aliens films  as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner  but moved beyond  i think  because the themes behind it were much stronger  anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write  i  d love to hear it  ,1,1
346,its almost amusing to watch year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potters followup to s the tango lesson  the man who cried  the geny actress  with her cold stare and big  black eyes  has appeared in an impressive range of films  but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film  set against the historical backdrop of world war   requires her to be  ricci  whose character is shockingly silent and blank  showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern  shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett  quite an amusing sight to behold  blanchetts lola  a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie  is bold  interesting and layered  everything our heroine lacks  costar of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy  blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci  sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe  the actress inhabits the role  as she always so remarkably does  with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the films lead rather than her dull companion  important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film  these landmarks serve as the films little conflict  obviously  the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events  whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues  the man who cried has many aspirations  none of which come full circle by the films close  there are forced messages here and there   go forward  always go forward   lola preaches to suzie  theres romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitlers nazis  the gypsy cesar  johnny depp  who  like ricci  barely gets to speak   lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it  and at the core of all these devices lies suzies desire to travel to america  where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago  the films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie  the time periods instability  the conflicting social classes  the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life  serving as both writer and director  potter throws in some of each  but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any  by the time the sighinducing climax hits  the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater  the films falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely  are we really meant to believe any of this could happen  contrastingly  in its moving final scene  the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film  although its apparent that potter cant grasp what she reaches  im puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place  riccis suzie is meant to be the films core  from the extended flashback at the films beginning to the quickly drawn ending  everything seen in the film  in some way  relates to her  so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals  the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble  but not present enough for the film to be riccis  the almost constant lack of flow and onenote tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha viernys beautiful cinematography that renders the films various locations wonderfully  also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely  and then theres the music  from minute one to minute ninetyseven  theres hardly a moment when the wavering  skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action  the notes stricken both overwhelm  particularly john turturro  portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio  whose money and reputation catch lolas interest  and accompany  oftentimes  the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state   potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note  unfortunately  the same effort isnt given towards  almost  everything else  ,0,1
347,damn those trailers  had it not been for the advertising of this film  which reveals far too much about its contents  i would have been glued to under the sand  as it is  the film retains some value  thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling  and a more mature francois ozon in the directors chair  marie  charlotte rampling  and her husband jean  bruno cremer  lounge on the beach  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim  when marie wakes up  jean is nowhere to be found  she contacts authorities  but they cant find him either  did he disappear to start a new life  was he killed by accident  did he commit suicide  marie still asks herself these questions a year later  and in order to move on with her life  she must find some answers  its a fine premise  and this little movie uses it to the limit  the film moves at a leisurely pace  a bit slow  but relaxing  its a very visual story  and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie  who shot the film in a dreamy haze  and the lead performance by rampling  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie  you connect with her character instantly  despite that shes delusional  the scenes where she interacts with her husband  who she still believes is alive  are heartbreaking  she cant quite get over him  theyve been married for twentyfive years  the other actors  particularly jacques nolot  are excellent too  the sex in the film is rather unneeded  but compared to ozons criminal lovers  its the disney channel  likely to cause some discussion afterwards  under the sand is a fine movie going experience  while its hard to recommend as entertainment  its a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss  ozon seems to ask what you would do  and thats certainly a hard question to answer  ,1,1
348,alien  is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  i saw it when i was  years old  and i must admit that i didnt like it  of course  i was expecting aliens again  and i believe this was my fault  in order to appreciate alien   you need to see aliens  but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor  james camerons aliens was an action film  and many people consider it the best in the series  i am among that group  but alien  is an extremely entertaining film  which critics have bashed for its originality  many thought the final chase scene went on for too long  and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  both are untrue  because the film has quite a bit of action  and the dialogue was essential and wellwritten  as for the chase sequence  it was long  but not overly long  creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion  perhaps watching alien  on video helped  on the big screen  i was overwhelmed by something i normally didnt see  it was a very dark film  and the language was extremely harsh  i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities  dont get me wrongim not saying films should eliminate swearing  but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks  it gets rather distracting  however  since seeing it again  i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters  as a result  alien s only flaw  albeit a major one  is the underdeveloped characters  we never really care about any of them  and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie  there were only two characters i liked  and of course one was lt  ripley  sigourney weaver   although we have gotten to know her through two other films  the other character was dr  clemens  charles dance   but because we like him  the inevitable occurs  alien  begins exactly where aliens left off  the prologue of alien  is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher  who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry  without using a single line of dialogue  unless you count computer warnings   fincher sets up the entire film  an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card  we see lt  ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments      title     a shot of an alien egg      title     alien legs stretch up into the air      title     and so on and so on  during these first ten minutes  i learned everything i had to in order for alien  to proceed  its quite a remarkable opening  and one which will remain in my mind for a long time  because of this facehugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens  the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod  and sent down to the nearest planet  fiorina fury  an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison  however  the facehugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryotubes  and is sent down with the escape pod  unfortunately  during the landing  all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed  ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery  of course  you need a carrier for this facehugger  and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates  ripley is revived and asks to see the ship  after seeing a mysterious acideaten section  ripley asks to see the dead bodies  and then have them cremated  this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films  featuring a monologue from dillon  charles s  dutton   a prisoner who has found god  the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dogs demise  its one of the most memorable moments  as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog  and this is where alien  succeeds  fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films  and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock  in fact  he is the mixture of both   fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it  and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films  alien  is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images  by doing so  fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise  many people have criticized finchers filming of the death scene of ripley  i reveal nothing by saying this  as looking too fake  but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal  showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch  but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron  a great deal of symbolism is derived  i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron  however  most people seem to want to witness ripley die  which creates a paradox  as she is the character i didnt want to see die   why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film  and i dont plan on spoiling that in this review  from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever  in alien  it was  of course  the moment the alien burst out of kanes stomach  in aliens  it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine  alien  has several  but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley  ripley is pushed up against a wall  and the alien stands inches away from her  why it doesnt kill her is a shocker  which later leads to a surprise ending  fincher apparently loves to use closeups of actors faces  michael douglas and the clown faceoff in the game in the same style   and by shaving off the actors hair  the only thing we have to look at is their faces  many critics didnt like all the actors being bald  but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot  most of alien  works when you take it in context of the story  but when you try to compare it to its predecessors  finchers turn seems a bit gloomy and dark  though thats not always a bad thing  the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films  with some major twists  again  we are setup with several different characters  and one by one  they are picked off  however  while the first two had tons of arsenal  especially camerons film   alien  takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this rundown prison  as a result  no weapons are to be found  this creates a lot of tension  although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense  as an alien film  alien  is the worst of the series  but by itself  it is an extremely wellmade motion picture  with a lot more merits than not  the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the onedimensional characters  i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about  despite this  ripley was the central figure  and thats what is important  we care for her  even though she began to act just like one of the guys  again  the technical side of this film is remarkable  and better than the two previous versions  while camerons version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary  fincher uses brilliant camera angles  terrific lighting  and moody sets  the cinematography  by alex thomson  is very well done  with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie  the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in  as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around  the yellows  reds  and oranges of the lights create a dark mood  and by themselves create a lot of suspense  shadows dance on the walls  and yet those shadows could easily be the alien  the alien is different from its predecessors this time around  and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense  the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien  racing after the characters  the sets are quite incredible  which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien  the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed  the sets appear to be in the future  but not too far in the future  one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien  nothing surprising there   sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance  equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens  she was snubbed at the oscars for this one  mainly because the film was a critical bomb  her reactions are far more realistic in this film  with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter  its quite touching really  charles s  dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates  and i was on the brink of actually caring for him  charles dance turns in a nice lowkey performance  and as a result  i cared for him immediately  lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii  but he was more entertaining in aliens  the rest of the cast is pretty stale  though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world  alien  is rated r for strong violence and language  and sex  although it has its flaws  alien  is highly entertaining with rich symbolism  this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie  while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films  fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out  its a film like finchers which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity  the final scene   in fact  it tells us that we  as a society  have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little  fake   whenever something looks fake on screen  we immediately point it out as a mistake  but perhaps it isnt a mistake  ,1,1

351,when quentin tarantino made  pulp fiction   he was not only making the greatest film of the s  he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time  but before you send me hatemail for not giving that title to  citizen kane   hear me out  much like  citizen kane    pulp fiction  has changed movie making forever  but i think the latter has had a tad more impact    pulp fiction  has actually ushered in a new era of film making  it has altered the way films will be viewed    fiction  has spawned so many imitations  ive lost count  sure  some have been excellent   bound  and  the usual suspects  spring immediately to mind   but any serious moviegoer recognizes  pulp fiction  as the original neonoir of the s  in this review  i hope to change all the peoples minds who have criticized it for its excessive profanity and violence  which  by the way  isnt really that graphic   the most brilliant aspect of tarantinos masterpiece is the screenplay  it is filled with so much classic dialogue  the  quarter pounder with cheese  speech will go down in history   it should be required reading for any film student  if it isnt already  the story  told in unorthodox nonlinear format  centers around three main episodes  all of which eventually intertwine  the first  titled  vincent vega and marcellus wallaces wife   deals with a very loaded john travolta  i forgot to mention the cool heroin shootup sequence  taking mia wallace  a starmaking performance by uma thurman   his bosses wife  out on a date to a cool s restaurant called jack rabbit slims  they talk for a while  with the occasional  uncomfortable silence    mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror  after giving marcellus new bride a foot massage  he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse  giving him a  speech impediment   they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic  you never can tell   i wont reveal the rest of the story  but ill definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night  despite the cool trophy they win  the second story  the least of the three but still four stars  stars bruce willis  proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the  die hard  flicks  as boxer butch coolidge  previously in the film  like i said  its told in nonlinear form   he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match  as it turns out  he not only doesnt take the fall  but he ends up actually killing his opponent  he takes a cab to his halfwitted girlfriends apartment  and to make a long story short  ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch  sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flashback sequence  on his way home  he bumps into  literally  marcellus  the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers  which results in the infamous  gimp  scene  which is very reminicent of the  squeal like a pig   scene from  deliverance   the last  and best  in my opinion  of the episodes features john travolta  again  and samuel l  jackson  in the best performance of any supporting actor ever  as two slightly offkilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car  they seek help with a friend of jacksons  played by the qman himself   desperately in need of a stress ball  they end up calling a  cleaner  of sorts  played by the god among men harvey keitel  to help them out  in the end  the story brilliantly loops around itself  actually ending where it began  if you havent already seen the film  or even if you have  for that matter   i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition  it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen  earlier today  i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago  what the panandscan did to this movie is inexcusable  that version cut out  like  half the movie  what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing  for instance  when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end  the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses  this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place  just a theory    one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies  i  e    psycho   kiss me deadly    deliverance   etc    but why shouldnt he  its not like he outright and blatantly stole  give the guy a break  in case you havent already noticed  i believe  pulp fiction  is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time  up there with such greats as  casablanca  and  the godfather    trust me  you will not see a better film come out of the s  and besides  its one hell of a ride  note  if anyone knows how i could get a  bad motherfucker  wallet  please email me  any help would be greatly appreciated  ,1,1
352,phil  radmar jao  has a hairy problem  his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour  he recently met the author of a nonfiction book on lycanthropy  also referred to in the movie as werewolfism  and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf  using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention  he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him  and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs  made on a pittance  the film features an almost exclusively asianamerican cast  as directed by quentin lee and justin lin  the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films  jeanne chin plays katherine  a meek and softspoken wife  who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex  we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins  real and imagined  to her therapist  as her husband  jim  clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness  the picture is filled with stereotypes  theres a mysterious  loudmouthed waitress with a big  platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that shes a lesbian  she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer  a gay guy  and the lone white with a major role  the author on werewolfism  has wildly unkempt  orangey blonde  curly hair  from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist  the script rarely has anything to offer  the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were adlibbing  one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting  shopping for fangs runs     it is rated r for sex  violence  and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers  ,0,0
353,note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned    all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts   excerpt from as you like it  act ii  scene  when william shakespeare penned this passage  he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent  or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash  this is the world of today  and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical highconcept project like the truman show  truman burbank  jim carrey  seems to have the perfect life  he has a pretty  doting wife meryl  laura linney   a comfortable insurance sales position  an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven  a reliable childhood buddy marlon  noah emmerich   except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia  this is paradise  or so it would seem  bizarre  inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life  a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky  a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around  a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move  for the first time in his life  it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be  the truman show  directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol  is a remarkably wellconstructed film  paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next  balancing drama with humour  thoughtfulness with abandon  this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy  in many ways  mr  niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca  both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity  with pivotal  characterdefining moments occurring at sea  although the films rather conventional climax doesnt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds  and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch  there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception  despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film  it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment  constantly light and accessible  the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude  and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down  the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false  the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable  crowdpleasing underdog vs  the system formula  while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept  some elements are lacking  the device of mysterious laurensylvia  natascha mcelhone  as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing  theres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves  and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff  ed harris  with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience  thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film  in fact  although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers  it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even  more  deeply in the insulatory seahaven world  with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling  still  the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target  and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city  ive always believed that the versatile ms  linney possesses a tremendous comic gift  she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes  and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character  mischievously flashing a glazed  insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans  cheerfully going over the top  its hilarious to watch her  who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film  ms  linney is a delight in the film  but it is mr  carrey who rules the show here  he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank  the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts  but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal  its difficult not to root for truman  in a commanding performance  mr  carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence  and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn  demonstrating admirable restraint  theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening  and given his past track record  one almost instinctively anticipates mr  carrey to pull one of more infamous  and in this case  wholly inappropriate sight gags  its almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention  in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast  mr  emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness  the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic  white picketfenced smalltown utopia  and by burkhard dallwitzs original score  technical credits are firstrate all around  while the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film  its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one  obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound  ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british  tv series the prisoner  all the same  this is a visionary  awardcalibre film  entertaining  provocative  and intelligent  the curious  and possibly disturbing  thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous  its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching  if not actualisation  at least permissiveness of such a scenario  perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr  weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question  perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world  ,1,1
354,  psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred   a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget  third rate ripoff  but no  this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria  perhaps italian horror director dario argentos most consistently successful film  what impresses most in rewatching this surrealistic  supernatural thriller is that argentos directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a nearfully coherent narrative  screenplays have always been his achilles heel  confusing subplots  gaping holes  totally illogical incidents and reactions  no question  argento has always been a better director than a writer  fortunately  he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria  taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called  suspiria de profundis   the films storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic  provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches  jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance  arriving at the school late at night in driving rain  she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state  what happens next  and i dont make the comparison lightly  is a murder sequence that for intensity  shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcocks infamous shower scene in psycho  its quite possibly a homage to hitchcock  but with its baroque sets  graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin  this stunning sequence remains very much argentos own  though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspirias opening  minutes  the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school  we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters  most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious souroldmatriarchfromhell roles she does so well  several more violent murders ensue  including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is    well  i wouldnt want to spoil things now  would i  and the films climax  staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms  has a gothic ghoulishness thats most impressive  the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming  and not just for the violence  deep red and phenomena  for example  have been appallingly hacked about  fortunately  the cuts to suspiria  about  minutes in this version  have not adversely affected the film  the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done  too  excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region  and the soundtrack  it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else  as it stands  the use of goblins music in suspiria is outstanding  apparently  argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts  a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewers overall experience  even better  see suspiria in a cinema  where youll get the added bonus of widescreen  and the colours  deep reds  eerie blues  a superb use of shadow and contrast  the cinematography of luciano tovoli  whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female  is uniformly superb  a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors  these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argentos more surreal excursions  the other most notable example being inferno    on which bassan also worked  suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors  and it is fully deserving of its cult status  the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated  thats always been one of argentos shortcomings  but overall this is a fascinating  compelling example of italian horror  ,1,1
355,if youre the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland  youre going to love the hunt for red october  youll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics  or if youre a sean connery or alec baldwin fan  or if you admired director john mctiernans earlier films  die hard and predator  in fact  the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book  since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them  the hunt for red october is an epic thriller  adapted from tom clancys best selling novel  set in an era before glasnost  the movie revolves around a topsecret soviet submarine  called the red october  the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system  which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection  the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius  played by sean connery  ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine  but he has other ideas  he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean  is he planning to start world war iii  cia analyst jack ryan doesnt think so  hes convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u  s  ryan  played by alec baldwin  is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub  the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin  but the performances  thankfully  are rock solid  baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor  sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connerys somber first officer  its ironic to see neil and connery playing russians  since they are both best known for their roles as british agents  connery as james bond and neil as reilly   ace of spies   the large cast also includes scott glenn  james earl jones  tim curry  and joss ackland  plus richard jordan as the smooth u  s  national security adviser  the special effects are remarkable  but more than anything  the hunt for red october is distinguished by its watertight plot  screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns  they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment  the movie doesnt get as sweaty or breathless as die hard  because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with nonstop action  the finale is rousing and suspenseful  but essentially  the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler  ,1,1
356,the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes  and the greedy trade federation has used its armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo  we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboos ruler  the young queen amidala  natalie portman  to sign a treaty giving the federation control  however  the galactic republic has sent jedi knights quigon jinn  liam neeson  and obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade  no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi  and the first battle begins  it seems that for me and thousands of people like me  the love for george lucass trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time  were the fans  not the freaks  we wont go dressing up like darth vader  although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool   and we wont incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations  not all the time  anyway   but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest  were throwing down  all right  stop looking at me like that  we have been faithfully and patiently waiting  waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll  you see  the trilogy is not just a set of movies  but a religion of sorts to we  the faithful disciples  and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah  unfortunately  it is not our savior  for weeks beforehand  i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good  stupendously good  miraculously good  anything less and itll be the biggest disappointment of the century  i didnt want the doomsaying prophecy to come true  really i didnt  but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking  character development is virtually nonexistent  with the possible exception of quigon  most of the films characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions  none seem very affected by their experiences  and few even show any passion at all  contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks  a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo  in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala  jar jars life is saved by quigon early in the film  and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh  or supposedly so   his speech mannerisms are so  cuteified  that i couldnt understand a third of what he was saying  and the slapstick he performed was just distracting  his head gets caught in an electronic field  his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast  he describes being in trouble as  deep doo doo   and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport  therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors  in star wars  we had obiwan telling us mos eisley was a  wretched hive of scum and villainy   in the phantom menace  we get doo doo  the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story  a long time ago in a galaxy far  far away      this film  on the other hand  constantly reminds me that its only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience  perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition  its kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses   and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy like play by play  i liked the pod race  it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension  but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters  the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction  this aspect  coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me  i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer  but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all  didnt millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in  over and over again  didnt the action figures still sell like hotcakes  of course they did  and its only poor judgment that allows the mosteagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults  one aspect that will appeal broadly  however  is the use of special effects  the people at lucass industrial light and magic  the worlds premiere effects house  outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computergenerated images and reallife footage  some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed  especially the shots of a land battle between the federations robot army and jar jars countrymen  the space battles are also impressive  although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer  this  however  is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today  john williams is back  of course  providing a score for the film as only he can  his music is pervasive throughout  as rousing and as dramatic as ever  always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately  since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nineepisode story  star wars  the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four  five and six  respectively   the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already  in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar  as a result  attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin  it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obiwan  for example  but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover  it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films  one of the new characters is darth maul  hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this films release  in spite of the hype  darth maul is a character which almost didnt have to be in the film  his role is so insignificant  he has maybe three spoken lines  believe it or not  a second actor voices the character  and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean  with that working against him  he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment  lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe  something which has been prominent throughout  however  he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible  offering an easy out for storywriting and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a reallife connection  oddly  while trying to capitalize on spirituality  lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little forceloving parasites in your bodys cells  this only serves to demystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection  dont let me mislead you too far  the phantom menace  by most standards  is a good film  it contains a lot of visual treats  sets the stage for an epic story  gives us a bit of excitement here and there  and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends  its just that when held up to its predecessors  and to not do so would be unrealistic   this film simply pales  ,1,1
357,perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects  there is no question that actionadventure and sciencefictionaction movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise  whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years  such as raiders of the lost ark  were made in grand traditional fashion  contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology  the latest in this visually awesome series of movies  the wachowski brothers the matrix  is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movies story  unlike many scifi movies which promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise  the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event  it runs  minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose  and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length  contrary to popular trend  the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound  in this regard  the movie is something like a card sharp  with its flashy mass stripped away  the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented  the script is characteristically weak  and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach  but  like the card sharp  the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent  the viewers dont care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner  and right around the corner they usually are  for the script tells a fastpaced  albeit frequently revisited story  as the movie explains  the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind  billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence  the matrix   farms  our life energy  only a select group of individuals knows of the  real  world  and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultracool morpheus  laurence fishburne   morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo  keanu reeves   believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth  the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion  the set design is very dynamic  running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy  the costumes  as well as the actors who wear them  add to the roles  for instance  the manifested antagonists in the movie  a group of  agents  created by the matrix in its computer program  all dress in matching secret servicewear  the rebel fighters  on the other hand  dress in rich hues of leather  the casting cannot be criticized  for the typically stoic reeves isnt required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool  supports in carrieanne moss  joe pantoliano  and hugo weaving are all effectual  one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city  particularly if one ponders how this same premise wouldve worked from a different approach  the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective  requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear  here  the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrillride motion picture with little abandon and much noise  the better picture between the two depends on the viewer  but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun  ,1,1
358,and i thought  stigmata  would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year  turns out i was wrong  because while  stigmata  was merely boring and selfimportant   end of days  is completely inept on all fronts  its a silly  incomprehensible  endlessly stupid mess  for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best  its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up  for the first time in recent memory  an arnold action movie  and  batman  robin  doesnt count  is no fun at all    end of days  is a major stinker  the movie opens in vatican city    some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy  which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation  if he impregnates her between  and midnight on december     the world will be destroyed  the pope orders protection of this girl  though some priests believe she ought to be killed  in new york  that very night  a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy  twenty years later  we meet jericho cane  schwarzenegger   a suicidal excop with a drinking problem  now working as a security guard for hire  he is protecting a local businessman  gabriel byrne   who is actually possessed by the devil  an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after  christine york  robin tunney   recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine  including ownership of the same music box  apparently   jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her  there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin  but how about starting with the concept  casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with  schwarzenegger is a persona  not an actor  so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  in other words  trying to give him dimension was a mistake  harrison ford  mel gibson  or even bruce willis could have played this role  theyve all played noble and flawed heroes   but not schwarzenegger  there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character  one has him contemplating suicide  another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter  and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back  none of these scenes really work  because arnie isnt up to the task  the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong  confident character  like the terminator  for example   the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before  this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him  the supporting cast tries their hardest  and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all  as the prince of darkness  hes suave and confident  he acts like one would expect the devil to act  the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense  more on that later  and that undermines him as a powerful villain  byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together  including the aforementioned temptation bit   but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable  root for the devil  byrnes speech about the bible being  overrated  actually starts to make sense  mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it  mostly of the  tis not   variety  are feeble at best  the only problem is  arnold has to win  so in the end  nobody really cares  kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides  but like most bad action movie sidekicks  he disappears after about an hour  robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared  in fact  all of the supporting players are good actors  but none  save for byrne  is given anything interesting to do  performances aside  it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it  this being an action blockbuster  its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script  which starts off totally confusing  and when some of it is explained  and not much of it is   its utterly ridiculous  why is the devil coming on new years eve    because its exactly  years after the year of the devil  which isnt   it turns out  some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down  so the real year is   so just add a  to the beginning  and youve got   if you dont buy this explanation  youre not alone  its convoluted and silly at the same time  the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous  shes christine  see  and she lives in new york  see        and if that werent bad enough  theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all  why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street  but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop  hes powerless  is he impervious to only one kind of bullet  how come he cant control jericho or christine  and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies  a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this  but its never actually explained  usually  this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick  i mean  dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies   but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting  there are several predictable horror film clich  s present in  end of days   complete with the old  black cat hiding in a cabinet  bit  not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there  it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a  boo  will come  their predictions will rarely be wrong  the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless  partially because we dont care about these characters  due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup   and also because they  too  dont make any sense  theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  its good for a few chuckles  but not much else  supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan  but the script never sets that up  so the scene is merely silly  none of this is terribly exciting  because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place  not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style  most of them had me scratching my head  rather than saying   wow  cool     end of days  is not only silly and confusing  but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch  the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle  illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible  but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight  this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort  but it also means that not a single scene in  end of days  goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence  or the odd kinky sexual encounter  yet another bit that had me scratching my head   if violence is supposed to be shocking  its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb  scenes arent connected through any reasonable means  so a lot of the time  stuff gets blown up  or people get killed  and i had no idea why  reasons  to hell with reasons  lets just blow stuff up  isnt it cool  nope  not by a long shot  this film is thoroughly unwatchable  its dull  interminable  and unrelenting in its stupidity  perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career  because its not happening with hack peter hyams here    end of days  might have had camp value  if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy  if the movie is going to be serious  the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script  if its going to be campy  arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously  i didnt actually see him put up on a cross  did i    and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack  as it stands   end of days  is just a bad movie  and an awfully gloomy one at that

359,the spy game is up  you can thank charlies angels  the movie  for that  when did banality and pandering become okay  just steal from hong kong  the matrix  and a kitschy tv show from the mids and thats a movie  charlies angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film ive seen in ages  charlies angels is dumb  just plain dumb  as we all know  three of the hottest females on the planet  drew barrymore  cameron diaz  and lucy liu  are three superagents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie  they all drive fast cars  look ohsofabulous even in the morning  and dont seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men  having buildings explode ten feet in front of them  or flying through the air in matrix slowmotion  and while the entourage spends  minutes romping around in cleavagebusting wetsuits  cleavagebusting waitress uniforms  and cleavagebusting wet tshirts  they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying  drunk sorority girls  the kind who hit on everybody at a party  the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer  the great sam rockwell  who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company  of course  the rival wants control of his new personal identification system  which involves such latterday buzzwords as gps  cellular tracking  and even mainframe  the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels  like battling each of them in many roundrobin matrix ripoff  again  fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to slicedoff locks of the angels hair  the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley  serving as charlies manservant  or  more to the point  the angels pimp  the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc  enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables  carboncopy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft  and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourkes longlost brother  charlies angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight  nothing is difficult  plausible  or believable in any of the angels actions  it feels like the matrix  mission  impossible   and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one  diaz is a knucklehead  barrymore is the  dangerous one   mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role  liu is just    lucy liu  looking good in a skintight black leather suit  the list of movies from which charlies angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing  the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon  lethal weapon ii  all of jackie chans movies  the great escape  saturday night fever  revenge of the nerds  payback  darkman  dr  no  the matrix  as mentioned   and even tvs friends  its a shame  too  because one of the many screenwriters  john august  was at the helm of last years favorite  go  then again  what can you expect from a director known solely as  mcg   there is no camp value in the film  no interesting main characters  no invigorating action scenes  no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players  note to hollywood  next time  lets leave the tv shows on the tv  ,0,1
360,mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tvshow er  her mast famous episode   loves labour lost   dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child  the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing  there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywoods big blockbuster movies  so its only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster  and i have to say  after a shaky beginning  she does not disappoint  peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists  which is obviously nothing new  the first half hour goes into detail  way too much detail  about how the weapons are stolen  despite a few good images  including a train collision and a very impressive explosion  none of this was very coherent  its long and drawn out  and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better  once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture  it begins to take off  george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world  he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters  nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling  there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two  but that is dispensed with quickly  the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe  trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them  clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm  frustration  determination  and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and selfdoubt  this is when leder starts to show her true stuff  she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer  then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter  then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york citys crowded streets  and a madman with a nuke walking among them  mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense  she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking  nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero  youre not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her  george clooney is a real movie star  many of you may have hated him as batman  but this guy is for real  he has a natural screen presence  and an ingratiating personality  hell be around for a while  dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker  ,1,1
361,after watching  rat race  last week  i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that  when not laughing aloud  i had held a grin for virtually all of the films  minutes  saturday night  i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didnt enjoy it as much the second time as the first    rat race  is a great goofy delight  a dandy mix of energetic performances  inspired sight gags and flatout silliness  hands down  this is the most fun film of the summer  the movie begins with zippy retrostyle opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a s slapstick comedy  featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herkyjerky bodies bounding around the screen  then comes the setup  donald sinclair  john cleese   the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas  enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients  to that end  he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines  gathering together the lucky token holders  he explains   today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six   the competition is simple  each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city  n  m   containing  million in cash  there is a transmitter in every key  so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead  the race has no rules  whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money  since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes  lets use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers  decked out in flashy  trashy clothing and sporting big hair  vera baker  whoopi goldberg  is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby  she finds that grownup merrill  lanai chapman  is erudite  conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life  thrown together  it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature  owen templeton  cuba gooding jr   is currently the most hated man in america  an nfl referee  he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a highprofile game  after escaping from a vengeful cab driver  owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention  mr  pollini  rowan atkinson  is a cheerful  odd little italian man on holiday in america  he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times  pollini hitches a ride with zack  wayne knight   a hypertense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation  randy pear  jon lovitz  promised his wife beverly  kathy najimy  and two kids a funfilled vacation in las vegas  fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race  he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview  beverly insists the family stay together  so they hop in the minivan and tear off into the desert  brothers duane  seth green  and blaine  vince vieluf  cody are young  crooked and stupid  blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly selfdone tongue piercing  and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him  the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal  finally  nick shaffer  breckin meyer  is a nononsense lawyerintraining who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet  amy smart  for the journey  at first glance  they seem blandly wholesome  but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn  dean cain  and spies him swimming with another woman  director jerry zucker   airplane    ghost   leaps from racer to racer  periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr  grisham  dave thomas   his personalityimpaired right hand man  continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers  as with any zucker production  a few jokes fall flat  but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps  high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally  with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny payoff  had i been part of the filmmaking team  i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a babys clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron  it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirminducing hint of child molestation  i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence  my god  do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing  all star   but enough carping    rat race  is a riot  with terrific noholdsbarred performances from the diverse cast  see it  see it again and when the dvd comes out  buy it  because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for  ,1,1
362,i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews  and in both instances  he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  now  i personally remember those films as a  starring a major motion picture star b  being funny c  having great action sequences d  great chemistry e  decent character development  hmmm     okay    now on to my review of chill factor  plot  a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an exarmy general  to propose a nuclear device to international prospects  when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps  they must keep it cool on ice  and rush it over to an army base  before the contraption ticks over  degrees fahrenheit  and kills millions of people  critique   speed on an icecream truck  is probably the pitch that was used to sell this onetone movie to its backers  but unfortunately  the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tensionfilled  original two hours of cinema  is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film  and the lethal weapon movies  stood for  this film is seasoned in cliches  with plenty of badly written dialogue  over the top acting from cuba gooding jr   zero chemistry between the two leads  and horribly tacky bad guys  tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe  my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent  because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously  written   that we just had to crack up  that  and the formula for the films script which followed the proverbial   and you guessed it     scenario  and what about all those catchy  hip names to get us to relate to the characters      elvis  and  nighshift   oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters  and yes  it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel   it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project  did they actually think that it would boost their careers  or did they know that the script sucked  but discounted any fall from grace  knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall  most probably the latter  have you seen either fled or bulletproof  well  despite the slight differences in plot  the essentials are basically the same here  you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people  having no choice but to work together to get somewhere  hating each other at first  but over time  learning to respect one another as individuals  yawn  add to that  the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black  drive black cars and black vans  and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head  not too conspicuous  eh  call me a partypooper  but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy  this film just doesnt even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining  one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside  and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island  do not a fun  buddyaction flick make  show cuba the money  everybody     little known facts about this film and its stars  this is not a little known fact or anything  but damn  is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like greatlooking actor johnny depp  skeets reallife nicknames include chester  skeeter and mosquito  he stands    was born in north carolina  and got married in  to that sexkitten actress from clay pigeons       georgina cates  they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs  skeet has a long scar on his chest from openheart surgery done when he was  to correct a ventricle defect  actor cuba gooding jr  was born in the bronx  new york  in   he breakdanced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles  he stands    actress hudson leick  who plays one of the  bad guysgirls  in his movie  is better known from her role as  callisto  on the popular tv series  xena  princess warrior   this film reportedly had a budget of  million   im not exactly sure where all this money went  but it certainly did not register onscreen  interestingly enough  director hugh johnson  who makes his big screen debut with this film  was the cinematographer on the  film white squall and the  demi moore vehicle  g  i  jane       ,0,0
363,the people who populate the movie  are shallow  selfabsorbed and selfindulgent  in other words  they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts   is the story of that wellpublicized new york disco  studio   the inplace in the s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled  photographed and pampered  the difficulty with   which was written and directed by mark christopher  is that his script takes no point of view  christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio s hallmark  he keeps an uninvolved distance  thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists  the movies one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell  the famous owner of the nightspot  he is part rebel  part dreamer  part shrewd entrepreneur  hes smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele  yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs  myers  in his first straight character part  is in turn appealing and appalling  at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation  then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash  the story is told by shane oshea  ryan phillippe   a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple  shades of john travoltas brooklynbound tony in saturday night fever  eventually  shane does come to new york  attracts rubells eye and is admitted to the promised land  his looks get him a job as a busboy  and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender  where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous  shanes dream is to meet soap star julie black  neve campbell   a fellow garden stater  but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up  its no big deal  the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent   is a very cold  uninvolving movie  its all strobe lights and glitz  all substance  its sort of like the musical era it covers  ,0,1
364,one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel  that concept  although many purists doubt its scientific credentials  spawned many interesting novels  comic books and films in the last century  however  the big granddaddy of time travels  h  g  wells novel the time machine  wasnt written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences  the author  h  g  wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich  idle capitalist class and impoverished labour  whatever intentions wells had  the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages  instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space  the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration  first of them was george pal  who in  directed film which would  through the years  become genre classic of its own  the plot revolves about george  rod taylor   victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension  time  at the eve of the new th century  george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention  machine that would enable him to travel through time  they are skeptical  but that doesnt prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future  at first  he travels slowly  seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars  finally  after witnessing world war three  he travels far into the future  hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions  when he finally reaches year    ad  at first glance  new world looks like utopia  humanity consists of young  beautiful  but idle eloi  people who are fed  clothed and taken care of by unseen machines  but  weena  yvette mimieux   eloi woman  tells george about another side of the coin  in the night  her people is preyed upon by morlocs  humanoid creatures from the underworld  the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature  the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times  for h  g  wells it was frightening threat of class struggle  for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan  who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war  it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust  underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie  even the modern audience  which would be tempted to discard the film as oldfashioned  could find some values in its universal messages  fit for each era  compared with the genre films of today  the time machine is even better  and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent  thoughtprovoking films  of course  since this is hollywood product after all  the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure  sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness  for example  it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future  same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters  while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today  some of the final scenes  that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero  are also rather unconvincing  but  on the other hand  the film is very well directed  cleverly paced and the special effects  although definitely oldfashioned  are more than adequate for this kind of picture  the acting is good  with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles  while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as georges trusted friend filby  yvette mimieux  who plays weena  on the other hand  would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role  however  despite all those flaws  the time machine is a very good piece of cinema  something that connoisseurs of quality sciencefiction films sorely miss these days  ,1,1
365,while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation  we had yet another shoddy  subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks  and  once again  we have one of the worst films of the year  the trend of the moment and bear in mind its a trend not a movie  is spawn  and if youve seen the animated series on hbo youll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man  an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment  hes been sent to hell  todd mcfarlane  the creator of the spawn comic book  must have had a tough time sitting through spawn  for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects  style over substance  ambience over anything else  not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects  the story  about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of  bad guys  and  find himself  in the process is realized in such a sordid  incapable manner  it becomes indigestible after a while  every character in this film is lifeless  vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student  the story begins  like in every superhero movie in this age  with a man living an idyllic life  al simmons  michael jai white   a government agentassassin shares the love of his wife  wanda  theresa russell  and daughter  has a tongueincheek  wiseass partner  terry  d  b sweeney  and is content with the job his boss  jason wynn  martin sheen   provides him  the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  and as expected  everyone turns the tables on poor al  as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant  al is befriended by jason  and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  inevitably  it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away  hence  jasons mischievous mastermind plan  to  conquer the world  is just commencing its initial stages  when al makes a pact with satan himself  agreeing to command the devils army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again  so  our pal al has been uplifted to hell  and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place  his ol partner terry forms a relationship with his wife  time passes  and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city  the ghetto where cog  nicol williamson  teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts  his motorbike  armor  etc    this character is merely a poor mans obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla  now the stage is set spawn  the new enemy of evil vs evil  and evil takes the cake  doubtlessly  john leguizamos deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the films relief point  all this anguish  pain  halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo  who steals the show and derives joy from his character  which is basically a compilation of soso one liners  and then theres martin sheen  whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years  his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent  as the megalomaniac boss  his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a bmovie  scrambled  and left in the shelf to rot  this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street  id never thought id be saying this  but at this juncture  charlie sheens career is in better shape  spawn is a movie in which realism  or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable  for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling  jumping through roofs  and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better  it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie a very bad superhero movie  continually the film kept on depending on special effects  and sadly  this is how pictures are being made  perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry  the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible  the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting  it is perceptible that director mark dippe  attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burtons batman did touch  the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act  but bruce wayne had human elements to him  he was pensive  resourceful and had relationships  which made our perspective on him equally human  the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change  as if hes fatigued about being normal  and as all superheroes  batman  superman  the phantom  they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary  none of this is present in spawn  the fighting sequences are weakly executed  the dialogue is pennydreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runners  as an example of this films vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten  and then rescued by spawn  so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic  admittedly  i did laugh once in the film  and thats when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum  it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature  besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system  i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn  movies that present no admiration  no captivation  no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to  and kids will continue to see films like spawn  simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative  wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one  children are not muppets  and spawn unapologetically targets children  ,0,0

367,  something is fishy in the state of universal   about ten years back  with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior  postapocalypse nittygritty survival yarns became popular at the movies  weve always had movies of this nature  on the beach  the end of the world  damnation alley  the ultimate warrior  and so on  to date  the most smoothly done were straightforward  haircuts  of the classic western plot  like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization  usually one in possession of some critical resource  like water  feed range  or a mining claim  most of these grew out of venerable  but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane    my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn  which was fairly well made on a small budget   now we have waterworld  which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter    well  shes not a widow  and the kid isnt her daughter  but you get the idea   the lady is helen  played by the stunning jean tripplehorn  who isnt given a chance to be stunning  or even interesting  by the mediocre and unimaginative script  the child enola  played by tina majorino  is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie  she outshines her material all the way through  in simple  the scene is earth  hundreds of years from now  the polar ice caps have melted  and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet  the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies  and survive by trade  theft  or piracy  somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries  and its inhabitants  called  smokers   are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials  so the bad guys have outboard engines  and fastmoving boats  airplanes  and jet skis  enola  found at sea as a young girl  has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back  we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical  dryland   the place where trees  crops  and animals grow  and what plot there is hinges on who has enola  the psycho ruler of the smokers  the  deacon   is trying to get her and find his way to dryland  played with typical selflampooning  rugchewing histrionics by dennis hopper   deacon  is the only thing in the movie thats close to amusing  his performance is  almost  laughable  but there just isnt enough there to be funny  the star  and a coproducer  is kevin costner  hes playing an unnamed lone denizen of the sea  a man called the  mariner   who turns out to be a gilled  waterbreathing mutant with webbed feet  very little is done with this  the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism  it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted  much of the earths surface would still be above water  and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown    canned meat does  not  last for centuries  ammunition does  not  fire after its more than a few decades old  and so on  and so on     im quite fond of tina majorinos previous work  very impressed by jean tripplehorns past accomplishments  and still speechless over costners dances with wolves  but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it  this movie cost one hundred and eightytwo million dollars  and theres  nothing  in it we havent seen before  done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey  at  minutes of material  this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make  the budget of this movie  could  have given us over thirty movies  it could have paid for six years of a primetime sf tv series with expensive fx work  or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx  in sum  this movie is beneath contempt  it has nothing new to offer  it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc  and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation  if you  have  to go see it  see it on a fourdollar matinee  otherwise youll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface  for weeks  ,0,0
368,one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting  the main story is about dr  james nookey  jim dale  who is disliked by his superiors  frederick carver  head of the hospital  kenneth williams   and dr  ernest stoppidge  charles hawtrey  who seems to dislike everyone  they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey  carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore  joan sims  on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there  when nookey arrives at this island  he meets gladstone screwer  sid james  who has lived on the island just about all his life  screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients  dr  nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moores financial backing  however  nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug  and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug  the performances are all very commendable  sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role  kenneth williams  as usual  plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital  joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey  charles hawtrey plays an outofcharacter role as dr  stoppidge  the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch  some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well  but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters  as a matter of fact  hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part  other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again  but this part is probably her most boring matron  and barbara windsor as nookeys love interest and unofficial womens lib campaigner  goldie locks  both jacques and windsor play their parts well  patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick  and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell  from steptoe and son fame  and peter butterworth  the jokes are mostly very funny  the story is quite appealing  and the regulars seem interested in what theyre doing  although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies  it still comes out on top  it is the best medical carry on  because of the above factors  a mustsee carry on movie  ,1,1

371,apparantly money talks      and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so  ive always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess  whether in language  violence  sex  or what have you  i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard  and money talks definitely does  its not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly  and i mean constantly    but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged  perhaps if one character were foul mouthed  but in this film  everybody swears nearly every other word  money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett  played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker   franklin is your typical conman and ends up with more than one person out to get him  when the plot finally gets underway  theres no less than three people  or groups  that want him  dead or alive  the frenchman whos somewhat responsible for franklins escape from a prisonerpacked bus  a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand  and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder  franklins only hope  james russell  charlie sheen   an investigative reporter for the local news whos out to prove himself a worthy journalist  james offers to help clear franklins name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel  conquer sweeps week  both of these elements are completely lost along the way however  and never do reappear  as expected  the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end  which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way  there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film  and so many developments are either nonrelevant  or just plain forgotten about  money talks is a paintbynumbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience  frivilous dialogue  a predictable  flat storyline  and twodimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money  ,0,0
372,note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  be forewarned  east meets west in mulan  the latest installment in disneys parade of annual animated feature films  an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmarket commercial sensibilities  this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years  but falls short of actualizing its potential  though not for lack of trying  in many respects  mulan is among disneys most mature efforts  skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat  the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized  the imagery of a pillaged village  neatly encapsulated in the form of a childs discarded doll  is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars  and mulans later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy  bloodless method imaginable  yet how often does a hollywood animated film  long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent  dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner  in an instant  idealistic mulans innocence is lost  and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending  the film  based upon an ancient chinese fable  centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her familys obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns  cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones  replete with glowing yellow eyes and daggeredged teeth  although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace   dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western  european fables and literature for decades  disneys new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere  story intact  to some neutral territory  and revels in its east asian roots  aside from a predominantly asianamerican cast providing the films vocal work  theres liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout  and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence  while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes  invoking pseudoasian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary  and i cant imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors  really  included karatechopping blocks of stone in two  its rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory  the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset  although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately  its startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulans land  at its core  the film is a tale of heroic adventure  and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour  perseverance  nobility and courage  as such  animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic  where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work handinhand with visual purity  scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action  such as mulans venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice  are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation  mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments  particularly during our heroines characterdefining opening halfhour  its when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation  the friendly animal sidekick  the colourful array of supporting characters  into the mix where it goes slightly awry  off to battle  mulan finds herself being trailed by a jivetalking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little  lucky  cricket  who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audiencefriendly comic relief  theyre affable presences  and not precisely ineffective  reasonable amounts of humour are elicited  and eddie murphy  who voices mushu  is amusingly earnest  but amidst all the high melodrama  the effect is mildly jarring and  from a storytelling perspective  questionable in its necessity  at training camp  mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits  easily characterized simply as the short clown  the skinny clown  and the big clown   who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness  and  in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns  she grows a certain fondness for a handsome  squarejawed young captain  shang  everybody needs love  even ancient chinese warrior princesses  but not necessarily in  this  film  the romantic angle  which lets the air out of the sails of the storys neofeminist underpinnings  lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation  another staple of recent disney animated films  a cache of hummable little ditties  has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness  composed by matthew wilder  none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing  and one   ill make a man out of you   unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines   becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable  only  reflections   an early ballad of lament  proves to be a song of any consequence  serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga  one of musical theatres most wondrously pure voices  nonetheless  mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory  with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork  the computergenerated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive  while the blatantly childfriendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film  theyre not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable  briskly paced with a smart  energetic heroine and filled with high adventure  the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter  ,1,1

374,at one point during brian de palmas crime epic scarface  the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves   cant you stop saying fuck all the time   fucking good question  that  it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride  but as far as i can tell oliver stones script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history  yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palmas scarface is remembered for  because this is a damn fine gangstar flick  the overall structure is similar to howard hawks  original  but this time the scene has switched to miami  florida and our antiheros chosen vice is cocaine traffiking  pacino  sporting a thick cuban accent  gives one the best performances of his career  golden globe nominated  as tony montana  a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream  and live it out he does  with lashings of violence  abuse  murder and the funny white powder  from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen  tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that hes not a man to be fucked  sorry   soon hes the king of the cocaine heap  but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing    never do your own stash   warns one character early in the film  as sure as night follows day  the emperor of miami eventually falls  writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here  stones script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development  montana is fascinating  uneducated but calculating  a straight shooter who speaks from the heart  an ambitious  violent man yet one with a conscience  a man fiercely protective of his beautiful  year old sister  not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy  dangerous world which he inhabits  pacino is dynamite  taking to the role with a brooding  bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting  pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life  only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children  and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends  and shes happy to oblige  this isnt as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stones was in casino  but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well  as director  de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva  the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations  a drug deal gone wrong  an assination attempt  is often thrilling  and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola  where he differs from  say  coppolas godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment  coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep  whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel  and it perfectly suits the material  the only major botch is giorgio moroders mostly crap synthesier score  its just not right  and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes  as expected  scarface is very violent at times  but you shouldnt be watching gangster movies if that upsets you  at over two and a half hours in length its a true epic  and if youre a fan of the genre youll love f   kfilled minute of it  ,1,1
375,when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy  the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass  toss out your usual objectivity  ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it  forget how unbearable it was to sit through  and find some meaningless way to compliment it  this  of course  will be of no service to your readers  but at least youll avoid the hate mail from the movies fans  thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina  not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot   directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love  she spent the last one third of her life on film  the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez  paulina was a maid in vickys household when vicky was young  i got to learn the films background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present  for those without such context  the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film  the acting is amateurish  the story is maudlin  and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie  grainy and overexposed  the movie  shot on mm film and videotape  has little to recommend it  confusingly composed  the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story  quite bloody at times  the story  full of horrific images  seems designed to shock and repulse us  why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody yearold paulina  another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her  in retaliation  she bites off part of his finger  this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood  the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner  one  for example  sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body  the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten  certainly she had to endure a miserable life  but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good  i felt trapped in the theater watching it  only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable  paulina runs     the film is in spanish with english subtitles  it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers  ,0,0
376,the event of events is upon us  people have waited twentytwo years for the prequel to star wars and diehard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it  i dont think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused  it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history  anyone who tells you  its just a movie  is either lying or clueless  it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic  the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz  which is far too weak a word  that star wars epsode i  the phantom menace so effortlessly generated  but that does not mean that the film itself is bad  in fact  it is terrific  i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash  it is set some decades before the events of the original  star wars took place  the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging  the trade federation  angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small  peaceful planet of naboo  the republic sent two jedi knights  people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as  the force    quigon jinn  liam neeson  and obiwan kenobi  ewan mcgregor  to negotiate  unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur  the jedi and the queen of naboo  natalie portman  escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene  on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine  where they meet the movies real focal point  young anakin skywalker  jake lloyd   he is an innocent slave boy  but  the force is strong with him  so qui gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi  as any selfrespecting star wars fan should know  anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker  from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie  around  of the characters  if not more  are computer generated in one form or another  and though the effects are seamless  the movie lacks soul  i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade  cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this  this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far  with plenty of broad comic relief to go around  much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jarjar binks  hes essentially a computeranimated sidekick who says things like  exqueeze me   and  mesa go now  okeday    and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying  the visual effects are astounding  although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them  and the movie is a thrilling triumph  if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement  the climactic lightsaber battle  oh  come on  as if you didnt already know   among other things  is outrageously entertaining and defines the term  popcorn movie   what made me surrender and give this movie     stars was the score by john williams  even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days  his work here is nothing short of brilliant  his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling  the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia  when you see  a long time ago  in a galaxy far  far away   when the familiar music plays  when the words  star wars  appear on screen  youll feel a tingle even if you didnt see the movie when it first came out in   it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin  a boy whose innocence  we know  will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side  it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts  we know that it will do more harm than good  but they do not  we not only feel more involved in the story  but we feel like were seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years  the phantom menace  although lacking in human aspects of the story  is a very worthy installment in the star wars  it works as an action flick  visually eyepopping and often paralyzingly exciting  it also works as an elicitor of memories  a piece of exquisite nostalgia     eugene novikov  ,1,1
377,synopsis  two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry  woody harrelson    an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post  tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye  has illtimed fits of coughing  and fails at everything he does  the story is told from harrys point of view  harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesnt drink  one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea  elisabeth shue   who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesnt smoke  seduced  harry agrees to participate in a moneymaking scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette  chloe sevigny   the teenage daughter of a rich man  turns out  its all part of a needless  very puzzling  extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme  it involves hiring special impersonators  by two cons in order to fool harry  a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post  when the kidnapped odette is found dead  the clues point to harry as the kidnappermurderer  and the police are hot on harrys trail  harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money  can he get out of this mess  opinion  palmetto is a long  uninteresting film with all the wrong feel  hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence  this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof  but palmetto is played like a dark  serious  detective noir drama  and watching harrys bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction  theres a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts  buttocks  short skirts  colored painted nails  and womens legs  even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema  you can always notice the side of elizabeth shues breast forming a prominent foreground  towards the end  palmetto refocuses on plot for the grand finale   a confusing explanation involving impersonators  with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession  if you can imagine shemp from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo lingerie suspense thriller  thats how out of synch this movie feels  ,0,0
378,the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and couldve been effective  such is the case with urban legend  the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks  the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends  examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house  the killer wears one of those l  l  bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up  so you cant see the face  i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days  anyhow  the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric  its a very good setup that promises more chills to come  unfortunately  the film never takes off from there  the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus  like most slasher flicks  this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac  or in this case an axe wielding maniac   ive always wondered why these killers dont save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill  after the fine first scene  the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying youthoughtitwasthekillerbutwasjust someoneelse scares  these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music  i guess sudden  sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days  the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast  the slasher appears  attacks  the victim is eviscerated  and the tedious cycle appears anew  false scares should always be used in moderation  someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just arent as scary as they used to be  this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commitits not frightening  remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in scream and scream   this movie still adheres to them  tons of illogical moments about  more than i really have the inclination to list  and i dont mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense  that type of illogical can be fun  this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember  the last  minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that youll be laughing more than youll be screaming  actually  you wont be screaming at all  at its best  the acting can barely be called  adequate  and the script couldve definitely used a rewrite or two  the film still manages to have some strong points  the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans  there are some intentionally funny moments    these were exceeded by the unintentional ones   the film is well made from a technical standpoint  besides the first part  there is also another good scene  a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station  if there had only been more sequences like this  that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music  urban legend mightve been worth your money  ,0,0
379,sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest  some people call it  original  or  artsy  or  abstract   some people simply call it  trash   a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings  definitely a generationx aimed movie  a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaokebased musical dream sequence  whew  anyone in their s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film  its somewhat silly  its somewhat outrageous  and its definitely not your typical romance story  but for the right audience  it works  a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting  well sorry folks  but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare  whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me  but i do know this  ewan mcgregor  whom i had never had the pleasure of watching  definitely charmed me  he was great  cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp  the audience may find it difficult to care about her  thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him  misguided  you bet  loveable  you bet  a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city  utah  this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke  maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise  but i think even if i had known  i would have been just as happy  a life less ordinary is quirky  eccentric  and downright charming  not for everyone  but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies  ,1,1
380,ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his  or her  sophistication  its full of stops and starts and usually  the punch line is ruined  i felt the same way watching drowning mona  skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy  there are some slightly successful attempts at humor  but they only serve as window dressing  there is a running gag about the town  verplanck  n  y   being a test town for the then new yugo  everyone drives a yugo  differentiating their cars with personalized license plates  even the police chief drives one  there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets  there also is a running gag about one of the characters  jeff  missing a hand and how it occurred  it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends  it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend  there are some sight gags that pop up as well  such as monas tombstone  which reads  demoted   instead of devoted  still  the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond  the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona  midler   each scene with her is the same  scream at someone  hit someone  then scream some more  theres no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness  anyone off the street could have played the role  such as it is  the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts  each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization  there is a burly  female car mechanic  so of course  there is a forced lesbianism gag  monas son  jeff  marcus thomas  is a simpleton  hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth  chief of police rash  devito  likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter  theres nothing more to him  elle  the chiefs daughter  campbell   is bland personified  a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married  monas husband phil  fichtner  jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch  bob  affleck   elles betrothed  and business partner to jeff  is a mumbling  obvious dullard  there is no contrast to any of the characters  by having at least one character with some wit  or wits  to serve as counterpoint to the others  perhaps steinfelds attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better  ostensibly a murder mystery  drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately  then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer  who could be anyone due to monas loving manner with everyone on town  even that aspect of the film fails  throwing in a convenient  ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things  its been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood  what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at its ineptitude  ,0,0
381,in the interest of being generous  i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black  sir anthony hopkins  playing a superrich media mogul  has gathered his family around him for dinner  his oldest daughter  played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing   who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party  presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes  which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes  hopkins  frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair  does what any man in his position would do  he punts  whichever one you like  dear  he says  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do  she cries  i liked that scene for two reasons  first  the cakes looked really cool  second  it was  perhaps  the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  meet joe black is chockfull of odd performances  people doing things for no discernible reason at all  and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot  its easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani  but its even easier to sleep right through it  two people on my row managed it quite nicely   the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess  i know my audience had problems with the movie  because they thought it was a comedy  case in point  everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie  however  the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani    its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death  but it makes a certain kind of sense   it shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  and indeed they do  after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt   because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished  well  when that happened  the audience howled with laughter  and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous  so  if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawingroom humor are funny  i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately  anyway  the deceased lawyers body  no worse the wear from its massive injuries  is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role  the idea is that death  given the pen name of joe black  so as not to disturb others  wants to take a holiday and experience the world  if this werent hollywood  we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death  but since it is  we get scene after scene of fishoutofwater humor  just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck whos wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesnt know how to act in our society  it also doesnt help that the character of death is written so inconsistently  he claims to be on vacation  but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani  just try to get your travel agent to book that one   he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois  he knows everything about some characters  nothing about others  and as played by brad pitt  hes not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing  hes just there  its as if someone told pitt   never mind about acting in this picture  son  just stand there and look pretty   its as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie  ive used the phrase  angel of death  in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance  nicolas cages in city of angels  where pitt is cold and unfeeling  cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man  pitt is aloof and arrogant  cage struck instant chemical sparks with costar meg ryan  where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlanis character is so shallow that she cant see beyond pitts good looks  the movies other top name is a much better actor  but that doesnt save meet joe black  sir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with  unfortunately  he plays one of these goodhearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood    one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkinss character more realistically evil   hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker  but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world  of course  no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder  but i have to wonder  and in this movie  you have a very long time to wonder  how you or i would act in a similar situation  especially if you or i were a multimillionaire  hopkins pretty much goes to the office  and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated  im sure  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black  and im asking myself why  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest  which is what im going to do now  go spend time with your family  go volunteer for a local charity  heck  go take a nap  dont go see meet joe black  because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death   curtis edmonds   no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it    sideshow bob ,0,1
382,well ill be damned    the canadians can make a good movie  the world is coming to an end  we dont know why or how  but apparently there is no way to stop it  the world has had this information for months  as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations  yet for a handful of toronto citizens  life goes on  they arent going crazy or attacking people in the streets  instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end    some engaging in activities theyve always wanted to do  some gathering with family and friends  and others just seeking to be alone  these peoples lives however all intersect during their final six hours  writerdirectorstar don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film  all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth  craig  callum keith rennie  tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies  a gas company employee  david cronenberg  calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business  and patrick  mckellar  just wants to be by himself but isnt having much success  even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to  tying everyone even closer  things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film  but ultimately everything comes together nicely  although its not a happy film    some moments are understandably gutwrenching   the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances  particularly from sandra oh  whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end  i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given  nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly  midnight  in toronto anyway   but i do wonder why the sun never sets  come midnight  the sun is still shining brightly  maybe the sun is crashing into the earth    who knows  also  its comforting to know that in mankinds final moments on the planet  people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus  thats not a shot at this film mind you    i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars   last night is available on dvd from universal home video  it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer  r ,1,0
383,guilt  guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time  the penultimate t  a thriller  basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living  but i know so well that its a terrible film  made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt  verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and  on november seventh    unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me  who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies  the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year  a simple  white on black title card reads  starship troopers  my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped  verhoeven realized he forgot the credits  is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open  were the rest of the film that subdued    starship troopers is about a group of white  blondhaired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names  they graduate high school  join the military  and then  rather curiously  decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet  the story is so incomprehensible  and told so bombastically  its akin to  minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue    aside  club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasnt changed in the future   one plus  starship troopers contains some very funny sequences  specifically the newsreels of the future  hysterically funny  actually  but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between  the storytelling lacks focus  to say the least  the politics of the film are scary  the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their outofcontrol libidos  theres even a creepy sex scene  the lovely dina meyer makes out  nude  with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater  just the way he seems to like it  i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ive encountered in a big budget picture  all chiseled features and machismo  he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders  of course  verhoevens probably the one to blame  and perhaps im jealous because im so disgusting  at any rate  a movie called starship troopers shouldnt be about sex  exactly ten years ago  verhoeven made robocop  which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving  and rrated  despite its goofy premise  maybe its asking too much for verhoeven to make a pgmovie  thenhes a master of insipid violence  however  ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it  ,0,0
384,vampire films  as well as other horror films  are usually dumb and predictable bmovies  meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks  it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning  but has also a plot worth making movies about  based on anne rices novel   interview with a vampire  is a long  dark trip to hell  the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of presentday san francisco  the camera slowly find particular window  a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness    so you want me to tell you the story of my life    the mysterious man is louis  brad pitt   a twocentury old vampire  telling his story to a fascinated interviewer  christian slater   his tale opens in  louisiana  just south of new orleans  where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat  tom cruise   given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead  louis chooses the latter  a decision he will forever regret  everlasting life and eternal youth  promised to him by lestat  turn instead into never ending suffering  damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace  louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat  but  to sate his hunger  he must feed  and the blood of animals is not enough  eventually  he pierces the neck of a griefstricken young girl named claudia  kirsten dunst   whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis  for a while  they are one  big  happy family   but all things end  and claudias growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation  when luis and claudia break loose from lestat  they travel to paris  where the eurovamps santiago  stephen rea  and armand  antonio banderas   who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned  director neil jordan   the crying game   together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere  as the film begins  there is an incredible palette of colors  beautiful sunrises  lush golden fields  green forests  inkyblue clouds and blending sun  when luis is  born to darkness   everything suddenly changes to dark velvet  lit only by the silver moonlight  the beautiful production design by dante ferretti  wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton recreate the multiple historical periods in the film  from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the th century  to our present days  the casting is likewise good  involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood  ireland and spain  the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective  cruise is energetic  sinister  charismatic  wild and bloodthirsty  cruises lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance  with alarming swiftness  the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror  as his murderous purpose becomes clear       kill them mercifully  but do it  you are what you are   for do not doubt  you are a killer   that is how lestat is teaching luis  but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages  brad pitt is equally convincing as the  vampire with a human soul   antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective  but since they play more or less secondary characters  their performances are almost invisible  the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst  who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character  the world is changing around the little child  but she does not  she remains unchangeable  a child for all eternity  only her wise  dark eyes reveal her age  ironically the films only miss is the script  anne rices novel is a very interesting read  and her script is rich  colorful and emotional  but it is also tiering and too melancholic  at times resembling a soap opera  claudia       is that what i should do  let you go   my father  my luis  who made me    who will look after me  my dark angel  when you are gone   luis   everything will be alright    claudia   do you really believe that   and then they hug emotionally  moments like those displayed above and luis selfpity is a bit tiresome  however rices script is otherwise strong and well structured  bringing up humor and comic episodes  that were more or less hidden in the book  when lestat finds claudias dead dressmaker  whom she has killed  he cries out   who will make you that dress now  be a little practical     never in the house   moments like that are both entertaining and appealing  neil jordans direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity  homosexuality  love and loneliness  his gothic saga is not meant to scare  but to display these issues differently  wrapped up in mystery  his new  original picture brings vampirefilms to a new height  ,1,1
385,remember back in the mid s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage    pulp fiction  and  fargo  both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture  and not surprisingly  a slew of ripoffs followed in the years thereafter  that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing  the way of the gun  that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable  its a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere  a film that wont allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  complexity should come as no surprise to anyone whos familiar with mcquarrie  he wrote  the usual suspects   which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim  that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate  confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings  you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that  if its really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating   with  the way of the gun  mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea  but this time the story is far less commercial  a shame because maybe that would have helped  the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but arent hellbent on death either  played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro   they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a bigshot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization  they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother  played by juliette lewis  and get a nice ransom  along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec  his wife  their hired goons and the  bag man   played by james caan  the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what hes doing   the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cant call the authorities for help  his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back  the execs son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right  meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the doublecrosses  secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all  mcquarrie doesnt know the meaning of the word simple  he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie  everything has to be complicated and confusing  so much so that its to the point of surrealism  nothing is what it seems in this reality  its one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industrys rules and regulations  every scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly  the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him  getting into conversations about  the business  and how it works and were hardly given a clue as to what theyre talking about  these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but theyre more like ideas rippedoff from sketches found in david mamets trash  no one here really acts like a real person  and the story is even further removed from reality  its like a dream without any appeal  take the opening scene for example  the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff  they sit on a brandnew mercedes and the car alarm goes off  the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they dont move  the guy and his loudmouth  pottymouth girlfriend and about  other people cross the street and gang up on them  youd think phillipe  and del toro are  going to pull out guns and scare them away but they dont  instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob  theres a lot of things i didnt understand about this scene  first of all the owner of the mercedes isnt some yuppie or old rich snob  hes like a hippie straight out of the s  secondly  the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed  lastly  it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small countrys army  if they were suicidal they wouldnt have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place  and where they get all those guns is never explained either   theres a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility  what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems  which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is  absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable  and its all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time  with any film you see  whether you like it or not  you can at least understand what the appeal was to it  why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it  i cant say either for  the way of the gun   because it has very little going for it and i cant imagine anyone intelligently defending it  ,0,0

shine  basquiat  angel heart  and grant morrison  dave mckeans graphic novel  arkham asylum   the cavemans valentine is a feverish tale of a homeless madmancumdetective who  on the morning of february

that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant  shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building  is responsible for the murder  romulus  samuel l  jackson  is put on the trail of an avantgarde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould  david leppenraub  colm feore   his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation  romulus was a brilliant julliardtrained pianist prior to his psychosis   romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his policewoman daughter  aunjanue ellis  that even though hes a nut  that doesnt mean that he cant solve a highprofile society murder  every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas  and every character the same  the cavemans valentine is a concept so  high concept  that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment  with romuluss  caveman  a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlanes urban noir hero  spawn  with a longvanished wife  tamara tunie  acting as a spiritual guide  the occasional social caste commentary  the secret base in a cave  a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters  and a wickedly colourful archenemy  the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars werent inscribed with  gotham pd   that being said  the cavemans valentine can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy  a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when  in fact  the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless  again like mcfarlanes spawn  while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  it is no small detail that our hero  romulus  is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life  in legend  without knowledge of his royal birth  but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park  in the romulus mythology  signs of romulus royal blood is brought by twelve vultures  while in the film  the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds  but of the carrion itself  whether or not romulus of the cavemans valentine will found a nation  or  in the case of novelist george dawes green  upon whose novel his own screenplay is based  a franchise  the fact remains that the cavemans valentine is easily the most misunderstood film of  thus far  it  along with m  night shyamalans unbreakable  is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has  since millers seminal  the dark knight returns   redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics  readers of sam keiths brilliant  the maxx  comic series  or of mtvs shortlived animated adaptation of the same  are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne  the failure of both  the maxx  tv show and of the cavemans valentine  not forgetting the initial backlash against unbreakable  suggests that the public may not be ready for americas surprising contributions to dark fantasy  luxuriantly lit  brashly saturated  and comicpanel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent  death in venice  ca   while inhabiting robin standefers  practical magic  mesmerizing sets  the cavemans valentine is an unremittingly gorgeous film  kasi lemmons  following up her brilliant  debut  eves bayou  which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism  fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys  artists and suffering  the cavemans valentine is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape  clearly not for every taste  when approached with the correct paradigm  it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year  a redefinition of the hero archetype for a postmodern audience with urinestained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes  the cavemans valentine is a fine and a courageous film  crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliots rats alley wasteland  ,1,1
388,theres more to a quilt than fabric and threadeach patchwork design has its own unique story  or stories  to tell  in how to make an american quilt  the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse  proof   we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality  all the sorrows  joys  longings  sufferings  and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and  as their bittersweet memories are given expression  one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future  motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals  how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative  the  quilting bee  consists of seven members  sisters gladys  ann bancroft  and hy  ellen burstyn   sophia  lois smith   a woman known for frightening children  emma  jean simmons   the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man  constance  kate nelligan   who has been having an affair with emmas husband  anna  maya angelou   the leader of the group  and marianna  alfre woodard   annas daughter  the project theyre busy with is the wedding quilt for hys granddaughter  finn  winona ryder   who has just become engaged  shes spending the summer with hy and gladys  and away from her fiance  to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants  and whether its better to marry a friend or a lover  one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast  from winona ryder  ann bancroft  ellen burstyn  and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn  claire danes  and kate capshaw  this film is overflowing with realized talent  the performances are good enough  in fact  to cover up many of the scripts weaknesses  how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable  if affecting  tale of love across the generationsa sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club  with a dash of fried green tomatoes added  there are probably too many characters  so  instead of really getting to know a few of them  we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives  we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy  and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible  there are other episodes as well  the love of annas life  mariannas soul mate  and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friends husband  the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finns story  whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger  there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt  the stories are all welltold  but its difficult to really connect with the characterstheir moments pass so quickly  while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals  our emotional investment is tenuous  there isnt enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way  and many of the personalities and relationships feel half formed  like a quilt with patches missing  to put it bluntly  while i enjoyed watching this film  it didnt  do much  for me  on the whole  how to make an american quilt is a nicelyunderstated drama that has a lot to say about love  passion  and monogamy in relationships  finns segment is by far the most compelling  because shes the focal point  her actions are shaped by everyone elses experiences  the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees  if theres a disappointment here  its that the script doesnt have more resonance  but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional  ,1,0
389,in the opening shot of midnight cowboy  we see a closeup of a blank movie screen at a drivein  we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses hooves  without an image projected onto the screen  the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our minds eye  even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie  somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema  but do cowboys really exist  or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper  exploring this theme  director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream  an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept  is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend  midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream  like image of the cowboy  is merely a myth  as joe buck migrates from place to place  he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself  only further degeneration  during the opening credits  joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads john wayne  the alamo   as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show  a lady on the air describes her ideal man as gary cooper  but hes dead   a troubled expression comes across joes face  as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone  having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth  joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody  joes persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream  he romanticizes about making it in the big city  but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance  by the end of midnight cowboy  joe buck loses everything and gains nothing  just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen  we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  but how realistic are these ideals  joe had raped and been raped in texas  the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york  but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas  alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation  the ability to pack up ones belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention  schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joes abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny  we understand that joe adopts the fa  ade of a cowboy  a symbol of virility and gallantry  as an attempt to neutralize his shame  he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york  in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joes encounter with the gay student  joe buck spills ketchup on himself  standing up  we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh  schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joes virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals  signifying emasculation  beyond the symbol of castration  the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgins first sexual encounter  a reference to joes first homosexual liaison  the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joes emasculation  it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients  but effortlessly attracts men  joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity  new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and faggot stuff   there are two predominant images of new york  the first is that new york is the rich  cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty  the other new york is travis bickles new york  a seedy  corruptive hell on earth  joe envisions new york as the former  but is presented with the latter  mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine  he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men  joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york  but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions  the people steal joes money  the landlord confiscates his luggage  and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity  what has become of joes american dream  schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party  joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food  drugs  and sex  at the party  all of joe and ratzos desires are made flesh  joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami  contrasting joes daily struggles  shots of warhols crew display wanton indulgence  there is an irreverence in the partygoers attitude  we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular  orgies breaking out in the periphery  and drugs passed around like party favors  the party makes a mockery of joe s ideals  joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america  scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joes toils  the american dream  schlesinger suggests  is merely a proletarian fantasy  for those who are content no longer dream  but become indolent  as joe heads to miami  all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him  his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished  for joe  nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately  he surrenders the identity  tossing his boots into the garbage  he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami  the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus  more introspective  taking only a few glances outside the window  instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york  schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe  reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus window with joe hardly taking notice  the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before  the world seems smaller to joe now  the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream  no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo  he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means  midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream  there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians  you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family  then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock  with perseverance  can make a fortune in the big city  joes attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york  during his search for an intangible paradise  joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man  an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream  joe bucks progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons  ,1,1

391,a movie like mortal kombat  annihilation works  and must be reviewed on  multiple levels  first  theres the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie  but occasionaly  almost as if making an ironic  selfdepreciating remark  the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery  no no    just kidding  had you going there for a moment  didnt i  in all seriousness however  and to be fair to the movie  it  is  necessary to provide two viewpoints  that of a movie watcher unfamiliar  or only marginally familiar  with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon  and that of a fan of the first movie andor a fan of the games  the first movie  mortal kombat     concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth  and its  billion inhabitants   the mortals won  and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth  unfortunately  shao khan was a poor loser  and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway  ready to take over the planet  as our heroes assumed a fighting stance  the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those  like myself  who are fans of the game  id even go so far as to say that many folks who didnt know about the game probably enjoyed the movie  the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself  and they didnt try to overachieve  there were a lot of really cool fight scenes  with really cool accompanying music   intersperesed with some distracting  but ultimately nonintrusive  bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot  and  as we know  the movie was a smashing success at the box office  mortal kombat  annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off  with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie  shao khan has decided that hes going to take over the earth  anyways   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament  thereafter follows approximately  minutes of film that alternates between being confused  being trite  being silly  and being just plain stupid  one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought  hey  that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a  real  movie now   too bad they didnt simply stick with the formula from the first movie  i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture  but here are the high points    the acting is truly bad  sandra hess  playing the sonya blade character  is particularly execrable  especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage  a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie     in one of the worst pieces of miscasting i think ive  ever  seen  james remar plays raiden  the god of thunder  in the first movie  christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke  a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics  i generally like it when actors are cast against type  tim  tiny  lister  jr  being cast as the president of the u  s  in the fifth element  for example   and remar has always been one of my favorite  utility  actors but hes so totally wrong for this part that he doesnt even have the luxury of amused selfawareness    there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important  but then never seen again    there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks  including a muddled scene where liu kang  robin shou  seeks out nightwolf  litefoot   has a mystical hallucination  and then wanders off with jade  irina pantaeva   for these reasons  and many others   i can only give the movie a         unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie  in that case  the following critiques also apply    sandra hess  while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson  who played sonya blade in the first movie   is much more convincing as a fighter  wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer  hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts  and puts together a much more believable fight scene    in the fights  each of the characters does at least  one  thing they do in the game  and often more   sonya does her  kiss of death   jax does his  earthquake   liu kang does his  animality   and so on  a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely    there arent as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first  because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between  silly  silly folks  and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mudwrestling match  lame and so obviously sexist even i  politically incorrect  for the most part  noticed and remarked upon it    the special effects are generally better  except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their  animalities   motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie  for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games  i give this a   youll probably like it  but not nearly as much as you liked the first one  ,0,0

393,  houston  we have a serious problem   after making  mission  impossible   brian de palma has a lot to live up to  by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew  he hopes to reach the modern audience  and the possibilities are certainly there  but the result is a great disaster  starting in a near future  with a prologue copied from  apollo    de palma slowly builds up his  story   the human race has already set foot on mars  a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened  this is basically the whole plot  so its hard to imagine that it can be stretched to  hours  but de palma manages to do that  it is not a very good achievement  as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space  the hardest thing to do is stay awake  the films major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is  david mamets dialogue  while trying to seem natural  is distant and simply fake  de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot  the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubricks    a space odyssey    apollo   and  godzilla   to make time pass  the creators have inserted several  refreshing  scientific details  that would not convince a halfcrazed frog  it consists of multiple copies and direct rippoffs from several great science fiction films and stories  when it finally presents an almost original idea  it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity  i cant even call this film predictable  since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this  sometimes it gets so cheesy  that youll start laughing when youre supposed to cry and cry when youre supposed to laugh  youll see enormous sandstorms  hear mysterious sounds and  last but not least  on this  constantly surprising  tour youll see  an alien  its really hard to find comparisons to such an experience  and i know that ive never said that before  i thought i never would   but  lost in space  is actually better  thats an achievement in itself  director brian de palma has stroke gold with  untouchables  that became an instant american classic  it is for this film that he will be remembered  while all his other failures will be forgotten  hell live to fight another day  i send the actors my condolences  since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters  and both the cinematography  production design and art direction are very decent  it is because of the achievement of  people  that i rate this film   unfortunately their hard work was in vain  if you have problems with insomnia  i recommend you this film  if youre not asleep within the first half hour  consult your doctor  ,0,0

395,an astonishingly difficult movie to watch  the last temptation of  christ may be scorseses most important film  and yet his most  impossibly abstract as well  scorsese presents the life of jesus  christ  through nikos kazantzakis novel  which details the life of  christ from approximately  until the day of crucifixtion  jesus of  nazareth  dafoe  is a carpenter  who opens the film making crosses  so  that he can escape the fate he is subjected to  his destiny on earth   yet  he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others   and subjects himself to a desert in exile  in hopes that he can reach  god  before leaving  he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene   barbara hershey   a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus    after going to the desert  christ learns his true purpose in life   and what he must do  aided by judas  keitel   he sets off on teaching  the world his message  along the way  he meets john the baptist  the  rest of the prophets  and tries to teach the world his message  christ  is also confronted by internal demons and selfdoubt  as he tries to  find his true purpose throughout the entire film  during the story   judas is the closese ally of jesus  his betrayal  argues the film  was  not out of hate  but out of love  in order to allow christ to die   he is eventually captured  and crucified as per the bibile   however  as he is about to die on the cross  he is saved by a girl  who  brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene  the girl is a guardian  angel who is from god  and who has saved him from his death  jesus goes  on to live a life as a man  as a carpenter  and does not die on the  cross  on his deathbed  in the final moments of his life  he is visited  by the prophets  and by judas  who denounces his master for  not keeping  his end of the bargain   judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil   and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act  jesus  escapes from his deathbed  and asks his father for forgiveness  for  succumbing to his last temptation  visually and aurally  the film is absolutely breathtaking  no other  director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of  christs life to the screen  peter gabriel contributes a score than is  simply astonishing  with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer  the  performances are simply exquisite  with dafoe leading the way with a  mesmerizing turn as jesus  keitel  although his accent is a problem  is  passionately brilliant  fighting through language to bring the character  to life  the visuals are also amazing  scorsese frames his movie in a  harsh tone  leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is  having human frailties  the film  though  has many trouble spots  paul schraders script is  one  schrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story  along  with new york words  new york mannerisms  and new york slang speech   the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ  there is  no underlying message behind the mans words  the film fails to capture  the glory and splendor of christ  had it faithfully explored that  aspect  than the dichotomy of jesus soul  his frailties and doubt mixed  with his unmistakable glory  would have been simply spectacular  the  message of christ is confused between love and violence  and the film  merely tells us jesus is great  instead of showing us his greatness  the film is also overlong  it just drags in the middle  with  nothing truly happening  christ is a confused figure  in the sense that  the audience doesnt know who he really is  schrader forgets to give  jesus a message  to show that he truly is the messiah  to give him the  divinity  without that  he is a rambling prophet  who the audience  themselves do not believe  there are several moments of accidental  hilarity  and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach   there are moments of brief awe and power  followed by moments of  confused hilarity  that said  the controversial temptation sequence is something to  behold  it is a step in an unexpected direction  one that leaves the  audience puzzled  until the arrival of the disciples  it is a simply  breathtaking scene  with jesus about to die as a mortal  it is truly  one of scorseses finest moments  it is unfortunate that scorsese  couldnt make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene   ,1,1
396,plot  a group of asbestos cleaners get a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum  as each day passes  the crew members begin to discover things about the place and themselves which set other things in motion  saying anything else about the plot would be a crime  have fun    critique   i feel like shooting myself in the head  are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie  a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here  this aint your average  happy go lucky  kind of picture  this is a deliberately slowpaced mysteryhorror film drenched in atmosphere  with a very creepy insane asylum  in which most of the film takes place   very few clues upfront and lots to talk about afterwards  will it bore some people to sleep  you bet it will  is it made for the scream audiences of the day  absolutely not  i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the  cerebral crowd   a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame  giving away very little with each step and each sound  unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later  ive always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group  in fact  i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a  mindfuck   if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly  gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds  tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together  well  then this movie is definitely for you  its the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate  damn  i missed that whole  peanut butter  thing   and one that will likely creep the shit out of you if watched alone in the dark    brrrrrrrrr    now what was that sound in the basement  honey  can you go check   and one thing this film doesnt have  unlike its hollywoodian counterparts like the haunting  is special effects  in fact  thats one of the greater things about this movie  it feels real because it looks like its actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances  i did some research and it was  in fact  shot on digital video    ahha    another great thing about it is that its actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme  and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen  its mostly implied  kids    and as clich  d as it might be to say    its usually much scarier when stuff is left to our imagination or implied in movies as such  other films that this one reminded me of include henry  portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project  with that same real sense of dread  brooding and terror  the film does however move awfully slow and if you really dont get  into  it completely  you really need to concentrate here   you will lose the motion of the story and the pentup tension might be released  but overall  this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight  and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can  how can you go wrong  definitely not a film for everyone but a mustsee for anyone looking to throw themselves into the psyche of the disturbed  count me in    stanley kubrick would be proud  oh yeah    so wheres that gun again     wheres joblo coming from  the blair witch project     blair witch      the haunting     the house on haunted hill     lost highway     the pledge     the shining     the sixth sense     unbreakable    ,1,1

398,it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive  so delicate  so insightful and yes  even so enjoyable  somehow  the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through  set in the s  the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells  tobey maguire  ride with the devil   an orphan  twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents  he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr  wilbur larch  michael caine  little voice   father figure to the orphans of st  cloud  obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help  figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage  he might as well be of use  dr  larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics  soon homer is delivering babies like a professional  he refuses to perform abortions  instead wondering why the couples just didnt behave more responsibly  larch  too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals  marvels that homer  continues to have such high expectations of people   such is the result of an insulated upbringing  though skilled in certain medical procedures  homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else  he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world  he must go out into it  befriending a young couple who had come to see dr  larch  he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived  thus  homer begins his worldly instruction  with new friend candy kendall  charlize theron  the astronauts wife  a willing tutor  tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to lifes questions    many of which he was unaware needed to be asked  he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing  michael caine is  in a word  brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans  many of whom he helped to bring into the world  calling them  princes of maine  kings of new england  in his ritualistic goodnight  mr  caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine  delroy lindo  a life less ordinary  has many powerful moments as mr  rose  the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins  director lasse hallstrom  whats eating gilbert grape   and screenwriternovelist john irving  the world according to garp   who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter  regardless of ones personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion  it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers  the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers  figuring the rules didnt apply to them since they didnt have a hand in writing them  they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along  dr  larch  in his own way  acts similarly  there is a danger in that line of reasoning  god has also given us a set of rules  unlike the list posted in the cider house  gods rules  if followed  promise us benefits beyond our imagination  and yet  many continue to ignore his  rules  preferring to make up their own as they go through life    trust in the lord with all thine heart  and lean not unto thine own understanding   proverbs    kjv just as a builder follows a designers blueprint or a conductor follows a composers score  why shouldnt we follow the rules of life given to us by lifes architect for our own blessing  ,1,1
399,jonathan demmes beloved  based on the book toni morrison  is a study in skillful literary adaptation  on the one hand  the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel  evoking morrisons pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice  on the other hand  beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book  favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the storys main events  this choice is a smartly made one  for it creates an open space in which the storys wide range of emotions can gestate and grow  indeed  the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled  beloved takes place in the second half of the th century  during the socalled reconstruction era after the civil war  for newlyfreed slaves  it is a time of confusion and turmoil  oprah winfrey is sethe  a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse  where she hoped the terror would end  what she did not know was that it would follow her there  and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished  beloved ultimately tells the story of sethes search for forgiveness  one longhampered by an unforgettable sin  the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethes escape  as a violent  unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse  invisible hands terrorize her family  flinging objects across rooms  shaking tables  rattling floorboards  sethes sons run away  perhaps for good  leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves  demmes matteroffact handling of this supernatural element is just one of beloveds intriguing aspects  all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real  when paul d  danny glover   a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe  arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghosts hellish visions  he doesnt run in terror  instead  he asks who the ghost is  as in morrisons novel  demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself  but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created  sethe is the one being haunted  but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears  in fact  the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay  the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved  thandie newton   a young blackclad woman who appears on sethes front lawn  leaned christlike against a tree stump  sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health  they know not who she is  but that doesnt matter  only paul d is suspicious of the stranger  little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes  and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years  winfrey is arguably beloveds greatest asset  she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show  lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe  whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later  danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d  as is kimberly elise as denver  sethes wanderlusting daughter  as sethes sagelike motherinlaw old baby suggs  beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears  the films least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself  thandie newton plays the glassyeyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first  but which becomes offputting and unintentionally laughable by the end  departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as the silence of the lambs and melvin  howard  director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrisons novel  totemic camera shots and colorsaturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demmes films  but the few he uses here work to the films benefit  beloveds most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs gatherings in a forest clearing  where the bright yellowgreens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs words do  for the most part  though  demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality  this  combined with morrisons equally frugal method of storytelling  may make beloved somewhat of a challenge to watch  even to those familiar with the book  though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well  it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film  nothing is spoonfed to the viewer  morrisons novel is just as enigmatic  but unlike a movie  a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb  the movie begins like poltergeist  and ends like the color purple  with shades of the scarlet letter and little women somewhere in the middle  taken as a whole  beloved is a disquieting  oneofakind experience  one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance  ,1,1
